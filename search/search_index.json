Image borrowed from nobledesktop.com Simplicity Excel GUI makes simple calculations, well simple! Many are at least somewhat versed, so sharing is simple too! Python Steeper learning curve This is unavoidable, but to our advantage our learning material is currated so that we learn python while solving relevant problems! You need to setup your own coding environment (Thanks Colab!) Automation / Data Connectivity Excel Need to execute xlsx file with relevant data (copy, paste, edit, paradigm) Python Integration with databases for easy update, chart or analysis delivery Scalability & Big Data Excel less than millions of data points poor version control Python more than millions of data points can integrate with querying languages (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL) has version control and containerized environments (like notebooks) extraction, wrangling, and analytics all in one place Side Note: The scripting language of Excel is VBA, this won first place (80% of developers who use this language stated) for most dread language!! in stack overflow's 2020 developer survey That being said, we won't only approach Python from a let's-replace-excel standpoint; we will also be approaching it from a coding standpoint: we write computer code to perform a set of tasks and instructions that the computer can help us accomplish . The real challenge and process of coding from an engineering perspective is how to codify a problem, and knowledge of what tools are available to solve it. I, and the TA's I have had in the past, have worked hard on this material to demystify the confusion along the way, while focusing on giving learning experiences in the relevant engineering and business problem areas. 1.1.1 Python vs other languages \u00b6 Our goal is to not only give an introduction to Python, but also to demonstrate general coding concepts. For these next few sections, we'll be executing various lines of code right here in this interactive, Google Colab notebook. If you're wondering how this is possible and how this all works, don't worry; we'll get to the intricacies of interactive notebooks later! You'll discover the many benefits of this general purpose programming language. In particular, The syntax for Python is understandable to read and easy to learn , compared to the syntax of other languages that requires more of a background of underlying computer science - languages such as Java, C, and C++. In this course, you'll discover that Python is especially ideal for working with scientific data. Topics such as data manipulation and visualization will be covered later on this week - all while continuing to utilize Python. # We will talk about what this cell is doing in a moment! ! python -- version Python 3.7.12 Note: this session is covering syntax for version 3.x of Python. As you continue learning Python elsewhere, please advise that Python version 2 is no longer supported, and older notebooks may be outdated as a result. source: insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020 1.1.2 A quick primer on Python syntax \u00b6 Python's simple, concise syntax allows for faster prototyping of code than other languages such as Java and C++. (However, that does not mean that Python has faster runtime execution than the others!) Printing output to the console is as simple as running Python's built-in print() function. To execute a code cell (we'll talk more about this later!), you can either click on the Play button next to the cell, or use the keyboard shortcut CTRL + ENTER ( CMD (\u2318) + ENTER on a macOS). print ( \"Hello, GIX Students\" ) Hello, GIX Students Variables can be created just by typing the name you'd like, followed by the equal sign, and the value you want to assign the variable to. In this case, we'll create a variable called some_school and set it to the value of \"University of Washington\" : some_school = \"University of Washington\" You may then use created variables elsewhere. For example, we can output the value set for some_school by inputting the variable name into Python's print() function: print ( some_school ) University of Washington A key part of coding is understanding which functions you need to use for accomplishing a task, as well as knowing when to create one of your own, which you'll learn more about later this week. For now, what you should know is that print() from earlier is one example of calling/executing a function that's already made available to us. \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 1: A Very Common Print Statement \u00b6 Now that you've stepped through our quick primer on Python, for our first coding exercise, try printing hello world! to the screen. Then run the code cell either from the Play button or the keyboard shortcut from earlier to see the output. You may have noticed me making new coding blocks without touching my mouse. You can do this by pressing esc then a or esc then b (for above/below) to create a new cell block where your cursor is. Try this as well # Cell for Exercise 1 1.1.3 What are variables? \u00b6 To have values that our computer can store in memory, we use variables . How else can we store information for later analysis and later reference? That's where variables come in, and is an essential part of programming! Here's a basic example of assigning a variable, using '='. Let's call this variable x and assign it an integer value (we'll get to integers in just a bit!) of 25: x = 25 Let's create another variable called city_name and assign it the word \"Seattle\" : city_name = \"Seattle\" And when we need to use this value again, we retrieve that variable by referring to it by the variable name we gave it when first assigned. The x variable we created earlier can now be used later, and as many times as we'd like. Existing variables can also be modified. Let's change the value of x , after printing its initial value: print ( x ) x = 150 print ( x ) 25 150 A few more notes on storing data as variables... Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory for that value. You can identify the location in memory using names. Rules: Must begin with a letter (a - z, A - B) or underscore (_) Other characters can be letters, numbers or _ Case Sensitive Can be any (reasonable) length There are some reserved words which you cannot use as a variable name because Python uses them for other things. (e.g False, None, True, Lambda, From, Global) If you want to have more than one word in the name, the convention is to use underscore \"_\" in the name. there was a time when camelCase was also acceptable 1.1.3.1 Variable types \u00b6 For your reference... Data Types Numbers floating point integers complex numbers strings boolean values lists and dicts NoneType In this section we will also introduce a built-in python function type() Let's explore some common variable data types in Python. The first type to discuss is a string , which we've already seen before when we initialized city_name . Strings in Python are simply a collection of characters wrapped around quotes, and a string can represent any kind of info depending on how it's used, such as a person's name, a city name (like we just demonstrated), or a complete sentence. Here are some examples of string variables in Python below. ... we can also use single or double quotes ... and triple quotes open whole blocks of string content ''' here's a stirng block with triple singles ''' \"\\nhere's a stirng block\\n with triple singles\\n\" 'single quotes' 'single quotes' \"double quotes\" 'double quotes' you have to use double quotes here... \"here's one with a single quote inside\" \"here's one with a single quote inside\" \"\"\" heres a block with double triples \"\"\" '\\nheres \\na block with \\ndouble triples\\n' type ( \"heres a string... I think?!@?!?!\" ) str The other variable types we'll discuss for now are integers and floats . Consider the Integer type as data that can represent any positive whole number or negative whole number. Recall the x variable we assigned to 25 and then 150 earlier? That variable would be considered an integer in Python. Here are some other quick examples of Python integer variables. some_int = 5 numbers_of_breakfasts_for_hobbits = 2 # notice the usefulness of tab complete for long variable names! type ( numbers_of_breakfasts_for_hobbits ) int what about second breakfast print ( \"what about second breakfast???\" ) what about second breakfast??? A float in Python is considered any number with decimal point values. This is the main difference between a float and integer. For floats, some examples below show an arbitrary number of decimal places after the decimal point, and ones where a value less than 1 (such as one representing a percentage value) don't require specifying a 0 left of the decimal point. # what do we notice is different here? y = 21.0 half = 0.5 data_generated_by_deathstar = 2.08 #exabytes/year star wars source # let's try something... print ( type ( 21.0 )) print ( type ( 21 )) <class 'float'> <class 'int'> We see that python auto-determines variable datatypes for us, in many cases! Python is a programming language in which variables are dynamically typed, meaning we do not need to declare the specific type of the variable when we initialize it . Because of this feature of Python, executing x = 21 will automatically turn this variable into an integer by default due to its value of 21. Likewise, executing x = 21.0 instead will make x the float type. \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 2: Create and change some variables \u00b6 Start by initializing a variable named hundred and assign it an integer value of 100 in the code cell below. THEN print the type of the stored variable # Cell for Exercise 2 Now create another variable called largest_computer_in_the_galaxy and assign it the string value of \"Deep Thought\" in the code cell below. THEN print the stored variable # Cell for Exercise 2 There are many more variable types to explore in Python, both ones built-in to Python and ones created by open-source libraries. The later sessions will cover more of these types, such as lists and DataFrames in session 2. 1.1.4 Math with Python (the moment I've been waiting for...) \u00b6 1.1.4.1 Basic operators \u00b6 Python allows users to performing mathematical operations fairly easily. As many tutorials will explain, you can use Python just like a calculator! The most basic operation, adding 1 with 1, is as follows, using the plus sign ( + ) for addition: 1 + 1 2 Subtraction is done with the minus sign in Python ( - ) and also works as expected here: 45 - 32 13 Multiplication is performed by the asterisk sign ( * ) in Python: 12 * 90 1080 You may combine as many arithmetic operators in one line as you need: 8 + 5 * 14 - 7 + 14 * 3 - 10 103 And based on the data type, you can peform the same mathematical operations for variables. Suppose a = 12 and b = 24 are already defined, we can multiply the two variables together by simply referring to their names and using Python's multiplication operator: a * b . a = 12 b = 24 a * b 288 \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 3: Discover More Operators On Your Own! \u00b6 Beyond the three arithmetic operators we have just demonstrated, there are more in Python to discover. To start, try typing 14 / 4 in the empty code cell below: # Cell for Exercise 3 Just by typing the computation and seeing the output on your own, you can quickly recognize that / is a division operator. Now try 14 % 4 in the empty code below. From the output, can you guess what the % sign in Python accomplishes here? # Cell for Exercise 3 \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 4: Order of Operations \u00b6 Be aware that order or operations apply for programming as well, and Python is no exception. Python follows operator precedence, specifically PEMDAS - any operations in parentheses ( P ) take precedence, followed by exponents ( E ), multiplication ( M ) & division ( D ), and then addition ( A ) & subtraction ( S ). Run the following code: 4 * 3 + 4 16 While that was straightforward, let's modify it to wrap parentheses around 3 + 4 . When you execute the code cell below, what output do you receive now? 4 * ( 3 + 4 ) 28 \ud83c\udf52 Enrichment : The difference between 5, 5.0, and \"5\" \u00b6 While more complex computations are possible beyond the basics that we just covered, you should first understand how mixing variable types can lead to errors and unexpected output. Consider two variables, num1 = 5 and num2 = 5.0 . From what you learned in section 1.1.3, num1 represents an integer, while num2 represents a float. num1 = 5 num2 = 5.0 For this example, what happens when we add num1 and num2 together in Python, as in, run the code num1 + num2 ? num1 + num2 10.0 As you see from the output of that operation, the result is 10.0, which is a float. What this means is that for any operation that uses a float type in Python, the default type of the result will also be a float . In this example, mixing an integer ( num1 ) and float ( num2 ) together by addition resulted in 10.0 and not 10, even if the sum is a whole number. Although mixing the two data types did not cause a runtime error, you should recognize this behavior in the near future, when such computations result in output that you may not expect - and possibly lead you to some functionality that causes an error elsewhere. Finally, let's discuss a third variable, called num3 , and let's assign it a value of \"5\" . num3 = \"5\" If we try adding num1 with num3 , or 5 + \"5\", what is our output now from the code num1 + num3 ? # num1 + num3 The output is neither a 10 or a 10.0 - instead, we receive a TypeError. Python does not allow you to perform mathematical operations with an integer and string together . Because num1 is an integer, and num3 is a string type - given the double quotes around 5 - adding the two together in Python results in this TypeError, even if the string represents a numeric character. The same goes for combining floats with strings: is our output from the code num2 (float) and num3 (string) any different? # num2 + num3 Nope! Same TypeError results here. One workaround/solution for this is converting ( type casting ) the num3 string variable into either a float or a integer, using Python's built-in float() and int() functions respectively. Let's try adding num1 and num3 again, only this time using int() to convert num3 into an integer type, running the full line of code as num1 + int(num3) . num1 + int ( num3 ) 10 This time, we get no TypeError - the output is 10! Without diving too much further into the intricacies of these conversion functions - the concept of functions themselves will be covered in more detail in session 3! - just be aware that this example only works because the string represented by num3 was a valid convertible string (\"5\") to begin with. In other words, if num3 was \"Five\" instead of \"5\", we would not be able to execute int(num3) without getting an error. # num3 = \"Five\" # int(num3) Note: There are some interesting mathematical operations you can perform on strings this will be useful to know for the Lab on data structures and flow control! \"Five\" * 3 'FiveFiveFive' 1.1.5 Code comments with '#' \u00b6 Comments are notes in your code, and can serve many purposes, such as: - Describing the functionality of some code - A reminder to fix an existing issue - Clarify details of some code for yourself and/or others You can create a comment by using '#', and when the Python interpreter sees this syntax, it doesn't run that as code and recognizes it as a comment instead . For example, for a mathematical operation, let's add a comment at the end of the line to describe what this performs: 2 + 5 # Adds 2 to 5, so we get 7 7 In this case, the # Adds 2 to 5, so we get 7 part of the previous line of code was a comment appended to the end of the Python code, 2 + 5 . By adding that '#' character, Python knows everything after that character is a comment. Additionally, you can write comments on their own line(s) of code: # Adds 2 to 5, so we get 7 2 + 5 7 You may use this syntax for code that you may not want to execute, but still save for future reference or revision. To do this, you can simply add '#' at the very beginning of the line you wish to comment. In the following example, I've turned the first line of the code in this cell into a comment so it won't run: # print(\"I commented out this line of code so you won't see this statement printed\") print ( \"There should be one line printed from this cell, and should be this one.\" ) There should be one line printed from this cell, and should be this one. we can toggle comments with ctrl + / \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 5: Add a comment to a line of code \u00b6 Let's write a comment that explains the following line of code, 25 % 7 . 25 % 7 4 Comments in your code are optional, but are recommended to help better inform readers of your code. Building a habit of writing comments may even help you understand and better explain your own code too! 1.1.6 Where can you run Python? \u00b6 Because of its flexibility as a programming language, Python can be utilized in many different ways. Here are just a few: Line by line in a Python interpreter in a command line Terminal window windows: windows subsystem for linux mac os: terminal As a script that you execute from the command line Using Python to create a full GUI (Graphical User Interface) that runs on your desktop computer Executing Python directly from an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as PyCharm , Atom , or Visual Studio Code Executing Python code with an app that has a built-in Python interpreter, such as Pythonista Developing and running Python code in interactive notebooks like Jupyter Notebook/Hub/Lab Executing Python on a cloud platform - such as here in this Jupyter Hub ( Google Colab is another free resource) You don't need to understand every example that was just listed. Instead, the point is for us to recognize how ubiquitous Python has become. We're about to focus on the last two items on this list in the very next section! There's much more to learn with Python! So far, we've only introduced a small fraction of what's possible with this language and, more generally speaking, coding. 1.2 Executing Python and runtime environments \u00b6 1.2.1 Using interactive notebooks \u00b6 After just having discussed the many ways you can deploy and develop Python, we'll focus on the one way that will be used for our sessions this week: interactive Python notebooks. Such notebooks - like the one you're viewing right now - are self-contained collections of interactive cells that can be modified and presented like a scientific notebook. By allowing us to combine code with formattable text, images, and interactive data visualizations, this gives us a great way to share and collaborate with others on our work. We'll next explore the proper interactive Python notebook type that you'll get quite familiar with during this series: Jupyter Notebooks. 1.2.2 Jupyter Notebooks \u00b6 Jupyter Notebooks is based on IPython, or Interactive Python. In fact, Jupyter notebooks were formerly known as IPython notebooks. Discussing the underlying IPython kernel which powers these notebooks is beyond the scope of this session; however, it's important to, at least, recognize where the .ipynb filename extension comes from. With Jupyter Notebooks, we can utilize the Python language right in a single self-contained environment of code, such as initializing and managing variables : var1 = \"A\" var2 = \"B\" var3 = [ \"A\" , \"B\" , \"C\" ] type ( var3 ) list We can also write functions that can be used later on in a notebook: # we were using built-in functions before. # but we can also define our own! def some_function ( x , y ): return x ** 2 / y ** 2 print ( some_function ( 7 , 12 )) 0.3402777777777778 Visualizations - such as scatterplots, heatmaps, and charts - can also be generated directly inside of a Jupyter notebook as a cell output, and can be saved as a separate image file. This also makes notebooks useful to generate both visual representations of data and interactive reports on that same data. We'll be covering visualizations in Session 6. from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x , y = make_blobs ( n_samples = 500 , n_features = 3 , centers = 3 ) plt . scatter ( x [:, 0 ], x [:, 1 ], marker = 'o' , c = y , s = 10 ) plt . title ( \"Example visualization\" ) plt . show () We certainly recognize that much of the code you have just seen may be unfamiliar to you, but these are all simply previews of what we'll be covering for this week! Here are some examples of how Jupyter Notebooks can be utilized: Reports on data analyses Data visualizations Interactive dashboards 1.2.3 Code cells vs markdown cells \u00b6 There are two main types of generated cells in Jupyter notebooks: code cells and markdown cells. You've seen both at this point. Right now, you're looking a markdown cell that's been created already by a different user. Think of a cell as just a single entity of your larger work inside of a notebook. Let's start with taking a look at code cells. 1.2.3.1 Code cells \u00b6 For writing and executing Python in a notebook, we use code cells. It may sound almost too self-explanatory, and you've already tried out code cells in the exercises from 1.1. To add a new code cell, you can either go to the Insert menu and selecting Code cell : Or by hovering your mouse over to the bottom of a cell and select + Code : And lastly. For code blocks, we can simply hit esc + a to enter a code block above or esc + b to enter a code block below. Just kidding one last note... we can delete a block by holding ctrl + m + d \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 6: Edit A Code Cell \u00b6 So far in this session, you've been creating entirely new code cells to write and execute a few exercises. Now, let's edit an existing cell of Python code. Below, we had our obligatory first exercise that printed \"Hello World!\" as the output. However, the code below, print(\"Hello World!\" causes an error, and does not output \"Hello World!\" as we initially expected. What do we need at the very end of the line in order for the print statement to run successfully? Note: I also want you to uncomment the following cell block! (how do we do that?) # print(\"Hello World!\" Code cells exemplify one possible benefit of running your code in a notebook rather than in a single Python script (.py) file; you can create separate code cells and execute each portion your code separately and as needed. That also means being able to troubleshoot certain lines of code without having to rerun your entire work every time. 1.2.3.2 Markdown/Text cells \u00b6 As the name suggests, a text cell is meant for information and instructions, rather than executing code for assigning variables, importing datasets, or generating plots. One benefit of adding text cells is to help explain code or functionality to viewers of a notebook. You can add a text cell either by going to the Insert menu and selecting Text cell : Or by hovering your mouse over to the bottom of a cell and selecting + Text : You may edit an existing text cell by just double-clicking on one and editing the code. You can also have as many text cells as you want, cells that comprise technically any word length. Depending on what purpose it needs to serve, such cells may be a description of a data pipeline, or a list of external links (like the ones you'll see at the end of this notebook). \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 7: Write a very UW Text cell \u00b6 Create a simple text cell that reads the official tagline of UW (hint: https://www.washington.edu/brand/brand-guide/tagline/ ) text cell for exercise 7 1.2.3.3 Markdown for text cells \u00b6 Text cells support Markdown syntax, which is a way to render and format plain text, in addition to giving us more control to structure this text beyond just visually. Markdown is optional and enables you to transform and annotate text within a webpage or here in a Jupyter notebook. For text cells, using Markdown improves readability, as a set of formatting conventions that's easy to learn and write . Markdown is a superset of HTML. Discussing HTML is beyond the scope of this session, but there are links to read more about this, later in the notebook. \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 8: Discover some Markdown syntax \u00b6 Create a new text cell below with the UW official tagline like before, only this time play around with: ##### at the beginning of the first line (hit enter after) ** surounding portions of the text * surounding portions of the text > on a new line for the last line (hit enter before) text cell for exercise 8 Later in the lab for this session, you'll learn more formatting syntax with Markdown. We also recommend trying out Markdown on a blank new Jupyter notebook for you to experiment with the all the different formatting this markup language has to offer. There is much more to discover with Markdown, and the References section of this notebook gives you a list of resources to learn more. \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 9: Always double check the type of cell you're running \u00b6 # It can be easy to mistakenly write something in a code cell, when you actually # wanted a text cell instead. For example... what happens when you hit the Play # button on this particular cell? 1.2.4 Other details on Jupyter Notebooks \u00b6 Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) don't just work with web browsers There are IDEs such as Visual Studio Code that have extensions which allow you to create and these .ipynb files right on the editor. Python isn't the only language supported by Jupyter, as you can also run notebooks with R and Julia as well, by adding specific computing engines for them. Notebooks - both in Jupyter and Google Colab - can integrate directly with GitHub repositories link to GitHub 1.2.5 ...So what does this have to do with Google Colab? \u00b6 Google Colab is based on Jupyter Notebook. Both the notebook platform and the development machine are hosted on the cloud - no need to install Python or external libraries locally on your computer! We'll be using Google Colab for this course. That includes all exercises and projects. Google Colab comes with pre-configured images with Python libraries pre-installed. Some of the most popular scientific libraries include: - NumPy - SciPy - Pandas - Scikit-Learn - TensorFlow - Matplotlib To view the full list of installed packages, run the following command: ! pip

The real challenge and process of coding from an engineering perspective is how to codify a problem, and knowledge of what tools are available to solve it.

In this case, we'll create a variable called some_school and set it to the value of \"University of Washington\" : some_school = \"University of Washington\" You may then use created variables elsewhere. For example, we can output the value set for some_school by inputting the variable name into Python's print() function: print ( some_school ) University of Washington A key part of coding is understanding which functions you need to use for accomplishing a task, as well as knowing when to create one of your own, which you'll learn more about later this week.

How else can we store information for later analysis and later reference? That's where variables come in, and is an essential part of programming! Here's a basic example of assigning a variable, using '='. Let's call this variable x and assign it an integer value (we'll get to integers in just a bit!) of 25: x = 25 Let's create another variable called city_name and assign it the word \"Seattle\" : city_name = \"Seattle\" And when we need to use this value again, we retrieve that variable by referring to it by the variable name we gave it when first assigned. The x variable we created earlier can now be used later, and as many times as we'd like. Existing variables can also be modified. Let's change the value of x , after printing its initial value: print ( x ) x = 150 print ( x ) 25 150 A few more notes on storing data as variables... Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory for that value. You can identify the location in memory using names. Rules: Must begin with a letter (a - z, A - B) or underscore (_) Other characters can be letters, numbers or _ Case Sensitive Can be any (reasonable) length There are some reserved words which you cannot use as a variable name because Python uses them for other things. (e.g False, None, True, Lambda, From, Global) If you want to have more than one word in the name, the convention is to use underscore \"_\" in the name. there was a time when camelCase was also acceptable","title":"1.1.3 What are variables?"},{"location":"S1_Python_and_Jupyter/#1131-variable-types","text":"For your reference... Data Types Numbers floating point integers complex numbers strings boolean values lists and dicts NoneType In this section we will also introduce a built-in python function type() Let's explore some common variable data types in Python. The first type to discuss is a string , which we've already seen before when we initialized city_name . Strings in Python are simply a collection of characters wrapped around quotes, and a string can represent any kind of info depending on how it's used, such as a person's name, a city name (like we just demonstrated), or a complete sentence. Here are some examples of string variables in Python below. ... we can also use single or double quotes ... and triple quotes open whole blocks of string content ''' here's a stirng block with triple singles ''' \"\\nhere's a stirng block\\n with triple singles\\n\" 'single quotes' 'single quotes' \"double quotes\" 'double quotes' you have to use double quotes here... \"here's one with a single quote inside\" \"here's one with a single quote inside\" \"\"\" heres a block with double triples \"\"\" '\\nheres \\na block with \\ndouble triples\\n' type ( \"heres a string... I think?!@?!?!\" ) str The other variable types we'll discuss for now are integers and floats . Consider the Integer type as data that can represent any positive whole number or negative whole number. Recall the x variable we assigned to 25 and then 150 earlier? That variable would be considered an integer in Python. Here are some other quick examples of Python integer variables. some_int = 5 numbers_of_breakfasts_for_hobbits = 2 # notice the usefulness of tab complete for long variable names! type ( numbers_of_breakfasts_for_hobbits ) int what about second breakfast print ( \"what about second breakfast???\" ) what about second breakfast??? A float in Python is considered any number with decimal point values. This is the main difference between a float and integer. For floats, some examples below show an arbitrary number of decimal places after the decimal point, and ones where a value less than 1 (such as one representing a percentage value) don't require specifying a 0 left of the decimal point. # what do we notice is different here? y = 21.0 half = 0.5 data_generated_by_deathstar = 2.08 #exabytes/year star wars source # let's try something... print ( type ( 21.0 )) print ( type ( 21 )) <class 'float'> <class 'int'> We see that python auto-determines variable datatypes for us, in many cases! Python is a programming language in which variables are dynamically typed, meaning we do not need to declare the specific type of the variable when we initialize it . Because of this feature of Python, executing x = 21 will automatically turn this variable into an integer by default due to its value of 21. Likewise, executing x = 21.0 instead will make x the float type.","title":"1.1.3.1 Variable types"},{"location":"S1_Python_and_Jupyter/#exercise-2-create-and-change-some-variables","text":"Start by initializing a variable named hundred and assign it an integer value of 100 in the code cell below.

Consider two variables, num1 = 5 and num2 = 5.0 . From what you learned in section 1.1.3, num1 represents an integer, while num2 represents a float. num1 = 5 num2 = 5.0 For this example, what happens when we add num1 and num2 together in Python, as in, run the code num1 + num2 ? num1 + num2 10.0 As you see from the output of that operation, the result is 10.0, which is a float. What this means is that for any operation that uses a float type in Python, the default type of the result will also be a float . In this example, mixing an integer ( num1 ) and float ( num2 ) together by addition resulted in 10.0 and not 10, even if the sum is a whole number. Although mixing the two data types did not cause a runtime error, you should recognize this behavior in the near future, when such computations result in output that you may not expect - and possibly lead you to some functionality that causes an error elsewhere. Finally, let's discuss a third variable, called num3 , and let's assign it a value of \"5\" . num3 = \"5\" If we try adding num1 with num3 , or 5 + \"5\", what is our output now from the code num1 + num3 ? # num1 + num3 The output is neither a 10 or a 10.0 - instead, we receive a TypeError. Python does not allow you to perform mathematical operations with an integer and string together . Because num1 is an integer, and num3 is a string type - given the double quotes around 5 - adding the two together in Python results in this TypeError, even if the string represents a numeric character. The same goes for combining floats with strings: is our output from the code num2 (float) and num3 (string) any different? # num2 + num3 Nope! Same TypeError results here. One workaround/solution for this is converting ( type casting ) the num3 string variable into either a float or a integer, using Python's built-in float() and int() functions respectively. Let's try adding num1 and num3 again, only this time using int() to convert num3 into an integer type, running the full line of code as num1 + int(num3) . num1 + int ( num3 ) 10 This time, we get no TypeError - the output is 10! Without diving too much further into the intricacies of these conversion functions - the concept of functions themselves will be covered in more detail in session 3! - just be aware that this example only works because the string represented by num3 was a valid convertible string (\"5\") to begin with. In other words, if num3 was \"Five\" instead of \"5\", we would not be able to execute int(num3) without getting an error. # num3 = \"Five\" # int(num3) Note: There are some interesting mathematical operations you can perform on strings this will be useful to know for the Lab on data structures and flow control! \"Five\" * 3 'FiveFiveFive'","title":"\ud83c\udf52 Enrichment: The difference between 5, 5.0, and \"5\""},{"location":"S1_Python_and_Jupyter/#115-code-comments-with","text":"Comments are notes in your code, and can serve many purposes, such as: - Describing the functionality of some code - A reminder to fix an existing issue - Clarify details of some code for yourself and/or others You can create a comment by using '#', and when the Python interpreter sees this syntax, it doesn't run that as code and recognizes it as a comment instead . For example, for a mathematical operation, let's add a comment at the end of the line to describe what this performs: 2 + 5 # Adds 2 to 5, so we get 7 7 In this case, the # Adds 2 to 5, so we get 7 part of the previous line of code was a comment appended to the end of the Python code, 2 + 5 . By adding that '#' character, Python knows everything after that character is a comment. Additionally, you can write comments on their own line(s) of code: # Adds 2 to 5, so we get 7 2 + 5 7 You may use this syntax for code that you may not want to execute, but still save for future reference or revision.

By allowing us to combine code with formattable text, images, and interactive data visualizations, this gives us a great way to share and collaborate with others on our work.

In fact, Jupyter notebooks were formerly known as IPython notebooks. Discussing the underlying IPython kernel which powers these notebooks is beyond the scope of this session; however, it's important to, at least, recognize where the .ipynb filename extension comes from. With Jupyter Notebooks, we can utilize the Python language right in a single self-contained environment of code, such as initializing and managing variables : var1 = \"A\" var2 = \"B\" var3 = [ \"A\" , \"B\" , \"C\" ] type ( var3 ) list We can also write functions that can be used later on in a notebook: # we were using built-in functions before. # but we can also define our own! def some_function ( x , y ): return x ** 2 / y ** 2 print ( some_function ( 7 , 12 )) 0.3402777777777778 Visualizations - such as scatterplots, heatmaps, and charts - can also be generated directly inside of a Jupyter notebook as a cell output, and can be saved as a separate image file.

We will close with seeing conditional execution and functions. Hang on for the ride! Normally, a notebook begins with import statements that import packages or libraries that do a lot of heavy lifting for us. We'll get to that later. 2.0 A quick review from last session \u00b6 Recall, we discussed variables and comments . 2.0.1 A quick review of variables \u00b6 Variables are human names we give data objects in our code. Variables in Python should be named using appropriate descriptions of their purpose. By convention, most variable names are lower case and may optionally contain the underscore character (' _ '). So far, you've only seen examples of functions and variables in Python, but eventually you will encounter all the types of python objects in this table! Type Naming Convention Examples Function Use a lowercase word or words. Separate words by underscores to improve readability. function, my_function Variable Use a lowercase single letter, word, or words. Separate words with underscores to improve readability. x, var, my_variable Constant Use an uppercase single letter, word or words. Separate words with underscores to improve readability. CONSTANT, MY_CONSTANT, MY_LONG_CONSTANT Method Use a lowercase word or words. Separate words with underscores to improve readability. class_method, method Class Start each word with a capital letter. Do not separate words with underscores. This style is called camel case. Model, MyClass Module Use a short, lowercase word or words. Separate words with underscores to improve readability. module.py, my_module.py Package Use a short, lowercase word or words. Do not separate words with underscores. package, mypackage Some names you might want to use are off-limits because they are reserved words , meaning they are words in Python that have special meaning. Examples of reserved words that you should not use as variable names are in the table below. The ones in bold are ones we will use in the session today. Remember, these can't be used as variable names! import True False if else def in not and or None from continue pass class await raise del lambda return elif with as finally nonlocal while assert except global yield break try global Let's see an example of a decimal point containing number, known to computers as a floating point number. Let's use \\(\\pi\\) as the number. (Pro tip: you can write equations in Markdown. See this reference .) pickles = 3.14 print(pickles) pickles = 3.14 print ( pickles ) 3.14 Cool. We defined a variable named pickles containing a poor estimate of \\(\\pi\\). Now every place the word pickles appears, it will have the value 3.14 , at least until we change it. \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 1: Picking variable names \u00b6 Is pickles a good variable name for the value \\(\\pi\\)? If not, what would be a better name? Is it in the reserved word list above? Use the code cell below to create a new variable with your preferred name in it. # Cell for Exercise 1 Variables can change their value in Python so we can change the value of pickles to something else. For example, a definition of what pickles are. pickles = \"A cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.\" print(pickles) pickles = \"A cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.\" print ( pickles ) A cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine. 2.0.2 A quick review of comments \u00b6 Just like we should use good naming conventions for variables so they make sense, we should have good comments to help readers follow our code. Good comments can turn a speck of coding gold into a valuable nugget of knowledge. Bad or wrong comments are bugs. If you want to learn more about why we call computer coding problems bugs, read about Grace Hopper and see her photo of a bug in her notebook . To comment out some text, use the # or hashtag or sometimes called the pound character. # This is an example comment. Notice it is in english and full sentences. That is good style. # This is an example comment. Notice it is in english and full sentences. That is good style. 2.1 Data Structures: Variables that organize data \u00b6 Many variables you will encounter are more than the above simple data types (integers, strings, floating point numbers). In fact, they may contain a few to many pieces of data rolled into one thing or data structure . Next, we'll discuss two important data structures : lists and dictionaries . There are many advanced data structures in Python that behave like lists and dictionaries , in different settings but their concepts are often similar. Thus, understanding them here will help us understand more advanced concepts. Let's start with the venerable list . 2.1.1 Lists \u00b6 For more than just shopping. A list is an ordered collection of data. By collection , we mean that it contains multiple data. By ordered , we mean that the data are arranged so that they appear first to last like words in a sentence. The order is important for the meaning of the sentence. Let's begin by creating a list variable named my_list that contains three pieces of information. my_list = ['I', 'like', 'pie'] my_list my_list = [ 'I' , 'like' , 'pie' ] my_list ['I', 'like', 'pie'] Now the value of the variable my_list points to a list of three strings. The use of [ , ] , and , are used to denote the begining, end and separator of the list. Like a sentence, this list of words is ordered. I like pie. Notice, we didn't use a print() on the variable. The last variable expression in a cell is shown in the notebook by default. The elements in a list have indices. That is, to access an element in the list, you can refer to it by its index. Think of a list like a very simple table. index value 0 'I' 1 'like' 2 'pie' People might start counting at 1 , but computers start counting at 0 . The first element in a list has the index 0 , the last element in a list has the index of the length of the list minus 1. For our list which is three elements long, the first index will be 0 and the last index will be 2 . Some programming languages also start counting at 1. These include Fortran , Matlab , and the abominable R . This is unfortunate. Be extra careful if you try to port code from those languages to Python. If you want to access a list element you can use its index. The index value is designated by appending [ and ] to the variable name with the index between. Examples are always easier than words: my_list[0] Given what you know... What will this output? my_list [ 0 ] 'I' If you try to use an index that is larger than the length of the list minus 1, you will get an error. Try it! The different colors means you made a boo boo! my_list[3] # my_list[3] The last line of the error report is the most informative for us now. It should read: IndexError: list index out of range It is trying to tell you that an IndexError occured because the the index you tried to access is out of the range of 0 to 2 , inclusive. Translation: stay in your lane, programmer! In addition to being able to recall or access a value of a list by the element's index in the list, we can change the value of the element. We will also use the [ <index> ] notation but like when we set the value of a variable, we will use the = character. Let's do it! my_list[2] = 'cake' my_list my_list [ 2 ] = 'cake' my_list ['I', 'like', 'cake'] 2.1.1.1 Append, and other list functions \u00b6 Finally, let's talk about empty lists and appending items to a list. An empty list is created by setting a variable to [] . This means the variable's data type is a list, but it contains no elements. a_new_list = [] a_new_list = [] We can append items to a list by using the .append() function . We'll talk more about functions later, but when this function or method is used on a variable whose data type is list, it will append the value in between the () to the end of the list. a_new_list.append(\"1st element\") print(a_new_list) a_new_list.append(\"2nd element\") print(a_new_list) a_new_list . append ( \"1st element\" ) print ( a_new_list ) a_new_list . append ( \"2nd element\" ) print ( a_new_list ) ['1st element'] ['1st element', '2nd element'] Finally, in addition to the .append() function , there are a lot of functions (or methods ) available for lists . See a complete list of them here . One more we'll touch on quickly is the len() function . It returns the length of a list . Here is an example: len(a_new_list) Before you run this cell. What do you think it will output? len ( a_new_list ) 2 2.1.1.2 Slicing \u00b6 Sometimes you want to make a list from consecutive elements of a list. This is called slicing where you cut up a list and get just the consecutive values you want. Slicing is done with the : character in the index area between the [ and the ] . Here is an example to pull just the last two items out of my_list . We use the first index, then a : , then the last index plus 1. Like this: my_list[1:3] You might be asking... WHY +1?? This is because with slices or ranges in Python are known as half-open intervals where the lower bound is inclusive and the upper bound is the non-inclusive limit. TL;DR : add one to the upper end of a slice or a range in Python. my_list[1:3] my_list [ 1 : 3 ] ['like', 'cake'] Just for giggles, try it with my_list[1:2] . You will see the range of the slice is only 1 . That's because 2 - 1 = 1 . my_list[1:2] my_list [ 1 : 2 ] ['like'] You don't even need to use the upper bound if all you really mean is the end of the list . For that, you can leave the index empty. Hot dog! Let's see an example... my_list[1:] my_list [ 1 :] ['like', 'cake'] But wait, there's more! You can set multiple elements of a list at the same time by slicing . Dig this! my_list[1:] = ['love', 'puppies'] my_list my_list [ 1 :] = [ 'love' , 'puppies' ] my_list ['I', 'love', 'puppies'] And who doesn't love puppies? Recap... Lists are ordered collections of information that you can recognize by their use of [ and ] . To access or address elements in the list, you can use indices . They start at 0 in Python. The last element of a list has the index of the length of the list minus 1. When slicing a list, use two indices separated by : . If you leave one off, it means everything up to or beyond that element. \ud83d\ude4b Question 1: Slicing \u00b6 Will either one of the following codes will return an error? my_list[:len(my_list)] my_list[len(my_list)] 2.1.1.3 Negative indices?!?! \u00b6 A brief note for folks who want to learn more. You can use negative index numbers to access from the end of the list towards the front. That is, a negative 1 ( -1 ) is the last element in the list. A negative 2 ( -2 ) is the second to last. The same rules apply for slicing with the : character. A quick demo example... Let's get last element in the list using negative indexing. That will be -1 . Here goes... my_list[-1] my_list [ - 1 ] 'puppies' We can also use slicing with negative indices . Remember, that slicing works the same way with negative indices , i.e. the the upper bound is non-inclusive. Here is an example using upper and lower bounds. Were you surprised by the results? my_list[-3:-1] my_list [ - 3 : - 1 ] ['I', 'love'] 2.1.1.4 Lists can contain most anything \u00b6 So far, we've seen a list containing some strings. That made our sentence analogy about the ordering of objects or strings in a list make sense. But lists can contain a mixture of data types and data structures . As a quick example, let's make a list that contains a integer, a string and a floating point number. This will be a four element list. zoo = [ 42, 'Elephants', 'ate', 3.14 ] zoo = [ 42 , 'Elephants' , 'ate' , 3.14 ] zoo [42, 'Elephants', 'ate', 3.14] We can even make a list of lists. META! list_of_lists = [ [ 42, 43, 44, 44 ], [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' ] ] list_of_lists[0] list_of_lists[0][1] a_list = list_of_lists[0] a_list[1] list_of_lists = [ [ 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 ], [ 'a' , 'b' , 'c' , 'd' ] ] The important thing here is to have the right number of [ and ] to embed a list in a list separated between , . Yeah, this is super meta. list_of_lists [ 0 ] [42, 43, 44, 45] list_of_lists [ 0 ][ 1 ] 43 list_of_lists [ 1 ][ 1 ] 'b' a_list = list_of_lists [ 0 ] a_list [ 1 ] 43 \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 2: accessing lists of lists \u00b6 Make sure you understand why the above works. Take a minute and play with the first and last indices. access 45 in list_of_lists access d in list_of_lists # Cell for exercise 2 2.1.2 Dictionaries \u00b6 For more than just reading on a Friday night. Sometimes we want to access elements in a data structure by something other than an index. Consider a dictionary on the internet . You look up the word on a seach engine and go to the web page of the entry for the word. Python has a similar concept where the index for an element in a collection is not a number, as it is in a list above, but a key that, may be a string like 'pickles' . 2.1.2.1 Key, value pairs \u00b6 In the case of a Python dictionary , we call the definition a value and the way we look up the definition is a key . This results in key and value pairs. One key maps to one value . In our analogy of a internet dictionary, this is the same as the word to definition pairs. Let's create a simple dictionary with a definition we have alread seen in the tutorials... Pickles. my_dict = {} # create an empty dictionary my_dict['pickles'] = \"A cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.\" my_dict my_dict = {} # create an empty dictionary my_dict [ 'pickles' ] = \"A cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.\" my_dict {'pickles': 'A cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.'} Notice the use of the # comment. Nice. Unlike the list, for dictionaries, some of their operations use the { and } brackets. Using a key to access or retrieve a value from the dictionary still uses the [ and ] brackets. Stick with it, for realz. Case matters in a dictionary because the key is a data type itself. my_dict['Pickles'] returns an error ( KeyError: 'Pickles' ) and the following does not my_dict['pickles'] # my_dict['Pickles'] This is a lot like the IndexError from the list case. Moving on... You can change the value of a dictionary key by reassigning it. For example below, we use the same key 'pickles' to change the definition of the word in our dictionary. Notice we still use the [ and ] brackets but we use the key instead of the index like we did with lists. The change we made in the string is that the cucumbers in pickles are usually small. my_dict['pickles'] = \"A small cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.\" my_dict [ 'pickles' ] = \"A small cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.\" my_dict {'pickles': 'A small cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.'} Let's add two key and value pairs to our dictionary which are in the table below: key value list An ordered collection. dictionary A collection with unique indices . Something like: my_dict['list'] = \"An ordered collection\" print(my_dict) Is probably where we want to begin. my_dict [ 'list' ] = \"An ordered collection\" my_dict {'list': 'An ordered collection', 'pickles': 'A small cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.'} # my_dict[0] Finally, like the list's .append() function , there are a lot of functions (or methods ) and attributes available for dictionaries. See a complete list of them here . (we will cover the difference between a method and an attribute more concretely later on...) 2.2 Flow control: If this, then that... \u00b6 Flow control is a fancy phrase meaning to execute some code statements under certain conditions. The simplest case, is an if statement (figure right below): If a variable is True then do something. If it is False then do something else, or do nothing at all. Flow control figure In the above figure: the selection refers to if statements Iteration refers to loops or repeating some statements over and over while changing a small number of variable values Sequence roughly corresponds to blocks of statements in functions . Flow control refers how to programs do loops, conditional execution, and order of functional operations. Let's start with conditionals, or the venerable if statement. 2.2.1 If \u00b6 Let's write a simple if statement if 5 == 5.0 : print ( True ) True Mathematically, the float 5.0 and integer 5, do evaluate to be the same! What do we notice about the second line? That's right, there's an indentation. Colab and most IDEs will automatically indent for you. Let's practice that below. 2.2.1.1 Indentations in python \u00b6 \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 3: Writing an if statement \u00b6 practice writing a simple if statement, notice the automatic indentation # cell for exercise 3.1 2.2.1.2 Conditional fall through and reserved words \u00b6 If statements can be used to execute some lines or block of code if a particular condition is satisfied. E.g. Let's print something based on the entries in the list. mission = [\"let's\", \"explore\", \"some\", \"data\", \"!\"] if '!' in mission: print('#notaword') mission = [ \"let's\" , \"explore\" , \"some\" , \"data\" , \"!\" ] if '!' in mission : print ( '#notaword' ) #notaword 2.2.1.2.1 in \u00b6 Notice the use the special reserved word in . This returns the value True when a value appears in a list and False when it does not. Notice how it reads like English. Readability is a key feature of Python and is part of the language design philosophy. Usually we want conditional logic on both sides of a binary condition, e.g. some action when True and some when False if '!' in mission: print(\"This isn't a full word!\") else: print(\"Nothing to see here\") if '!' in mission : print ( \"This isn't a full word!\" ) else : print ( \"Nothing to see here\" ) This isn't a full word! 2.2.1.2.2 pass \u00b6 There is a special do nothing word: pass that skips over some arm of a conditional, e.g. if 'data' in mission: print(\"Congrats, you're working with data, it will be grand!\") else: pass if 'data' in mission : print ( \"Congrats, you're working with data, it will be grand!\" ) else : pass Congrats, you're working with data, it will be grand! The use of pass here is very important. While you can actually skip the else and pass statements and the code will behave identically, using them is an important signal that you intended for the negative case to do nothing. Most of the time when pass is used, it is used as a placeholder for an eventual action/function/loop to be filled in. By using pass, we signal this intention . As a side note, I personally have felt the pangs of conditional fall through. Had I used the else/pass nomenclature, I would have signalled to myself that at some point in the future, I needed to explicitly account for when a specific execution of the code passes through this condition. Because I was not tabulating this conditional fall through, unbeknownst to me code I had productionized, was in fact not working exactly the way I intended it to. In short, when you have one side of an if statement that has no code use an else and a pass to be a good citizen. When you are writing code, you should start thinking about reading code and how others will read your code. Remember, the person you will collaborate the most about your code is yourself in 3-6 months. Note : what have you noticed in this session about quotes? What is the difference between ' and \" ? Another simple example: if True is False: print(\"I'm so confused\") else: print(\"Everything is right with the world\") if True is False : print ( \"I'm so confused\" ) else : print ( \"Everything is right with the world\" ) Everything is right with the world 2.2.1.2.3 if , elif , and else \u00b6 It is always good practice to handle all cases explicity. Conditional fall through is a common source of bugs. Sometimes we wish to test multiple conditions. Use if , elif , and else . my_favorite = 'pie' if my_favorite is 'cake': print(\"He likes cake! I'll start making a double chocolate velvet cake right now!\") elif my_favorite is 'pie': print(\"He likes pie! I'll start making a cherry pie right now!\") else: print(\"He likes \" + my_favorite + \". I don't know how to make that.\") my_favorite = 'pie' if my_favorite is 'cake' : print ( \"He likes cake! I'll start making a double chocolate velvet cake right now!\" ) elif my_favorite is 'pie' : print ( \"He likes pie! I'll start making a cherry pie right now!\" ) else : print ( \"He likes \" + my_favorite + \". I don't know how to make that.\" ) He likes pie! I'll start making a cherry pie right now! Note : There is a big difference between the above using elif and this code that uses sequential if s: if my_favorite is 'pie': print(\"He likes pie! I'll start making a double chocolate velvet pie right now!\") if my_favorite is 'pie': print(\"He still likes pie! I'll start making a cherry pie right now!\") else: print(\"He likes \" + my_favorite + \". I don't know how to make that.\") Before you run the cell, can you describe how these two blocks differ in their outcomes? if my_favorite is 'pie' : print ( \"He likes pie! I'll start making a double chocolate velvet pie right now!\" ) if my_favorite is 'pie' : print ( \"He still likes pie! I'll start making a cherry pie right now!\" ) else : print ( \"He likes \" + my_favorite + \". I don't know how to make that.\" ) He likes pie! I'll start making a double chocolate velvet pie right now! He still likes pie! I'll start making a cherry pie right now! 2.2.1.2.4 and , or and not \u00b6 Conditionals can take and and or and not . E.g. my_favorite = 'pie' if my_favorite is 'cake' or my_favorite is 'pie': print(my_favorite + \" : I have a recipe for that!\") else: print(\"Ew! Who eats that?\") Side note: We haven't mentioned this up until now, in the following cell, we are composing a new string using + and feeding this into the print statement: my_favorite + \" : I have a recipe for that!\" my_favorite = 'pie' if my_favorite is 'cake' or my_favorite is 'pie' : print ( my_favorite + \" : I have a recipe for that!\" ) else : print ( \"Ew! Who eats that?\" ) pie : I have a recipe for that! \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 4: Writing conditionals \u00b6 Write a series of two if statements, that both evaluate as true and print something Write an if followed by an elif statement, where only one evaluates as true and prints something # Cell for exercise 4 2.2.2 For \u00b6 For loops are the standard loop, though while is also common. For has the general form: for items in list: do stuff 2.2.2.1 Iterating through objects \u00b6 For loops and collections like tuples, lists and dictionaries are natural friends. The loop is iterating through an object we call an iterable . tuples, lists, and dictionaries, are all iterables mission for item in mission: print(item) mission [\"let's\", 'explore', 'some', 'data', '!'] for item in mission : print ( item ) let's explore some data ! Note that after the for loop has ended, the item variable remains defined and contains the last value of the list that was iterated over. item '!' You can combine loops and conditionals: for item in mission: if item.endswith('!'): print(item + \" doesn't look like a whole word!\") else: print(item + \" is a word in a sentence!\") for item in mission : if item . endswith ( '!' ): print ( item + \" doesn't look like a whole word!\" ) else : print ( item + \" is a word in a sentence!\" ) let's is a word in a sentence! explore is a word in a sentence! some is a word in a sentence! data is a word in a sentence! ! doesn't look like a whole word! Dictionaries can use the keys method for iterating. my_dict.keys() for key in my_dict.keys(): if len(key) > 4: print(my_dict[key]) my_dict . keys () dict_keys(['pickles', 'list']) for key in my_dict . keys (): if len ( key ) > 4 : print ( my_dict [ key ]) A small cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine. Strings are basically a list. Therefore, you can use a for loop to iterate over the characters in a string. Note that c is a typical variable name for characters in a string. Generally, one letter variable names are not a good thing. my_string = \"caffeine\" for c in my_string: print(c) my_string = \"caffeine\" for c in my_string : print ( c ) c a f f e i n e 2.2.2.2 range() \u00b6 Manually constructing a list of sequential numbers is a total pain. A total pain. So Python has a function called range that simplifies the creation of lists that contain a sequence. Let's see it in action! Note that if we want a sequence from 0 to 2, inclusive, we call the range function with a argument of 3 . This is like the upper bound in slicing - it is always 1 plus the maximum value you want in the list. range(3) range ( 3 ) range(0, 3) Wait up, hoss. That result doesn't look like a list! True. However, it acts identically to a list, but works a little different under the hood to save memory. The equivalent hand made list would look like this: [0, 1, 2] [ 0 , 1 , 2 ] [0, 1, 2] 2.2.2.2.1 list , type cast function \u00b6 We can convert a range to a list by using the list type cast function . list(range(3)) list ( range ( 3 )) [0, 1, 2] Notice that Python (in the newest versions, e.g. 3+) has an object type that is a range. This saves memory and speeds up calculations vs. an explicit representation of a range as a list - but it can be automagically converted to a list on the fly by Python. To show the contents as a list we can use the type case like with the tuple above. Sometimes, in older Python docs, you will see xrange . This used the range object back in Python 2 and range returned an actual list. Beware of this! list ( range ( 3 )) [0, 1, 2] Remember earlier with slicing, the syntax :3 meant [0, 1, 2] ? Well, the same upper bound philosophy applies here. xs = [0, 1, 2] for x in xs[0:1]: if x < 2: print(x) else: pass xs = [ 0 , 1 , 2 ] for x in xs [ 0 : 1 ]: if x < 2 : print ( x ) else : pass 0 Let's use range to acccess our list, mission using list element indexing. for index in range(5): item = mission[index] if item.endswith('!'): print(item + \" doesn't look like a whole word!\") else: print(item + \" is a word in a sentence!\") for index in range ( 5 ): item = mission [ index ] if item . endswith ( '!' ): print ( item + \" doesn't look like a whole word!\" ) else : print ( item + \" is a word in a sentence!\" ) let's is a word in a sentence! explore is a word in a sentence! some is a word in a sentence! data is a word in a sentence! ! doesn't look like a whole word! This would probably be better written as below. Why is it better to use to use the len() function than hard code the length of the list? for index in range(len(mission)): item = mission[index] if item.endswith('!'): print(item + \" doesn't look like a whole word!\") else: print(item + \" is a word in a sentence!\") for index in range ( len ( mission )): item = mission [ index ] if item . endswith ( '!' ): print ( item + \" doesn't look like a whole word!\" ) else : print ( item + \" is a word in a sentence!\" ) let's is a word in a sentence! explore is a word in a sentence! some is a word in a sentence! data is a word in a sentence! ! doesn't look like a whole word! But in all, it isn't very Pythonesque to use indexes like that (unless you have another reason in the loop) and you would opt instead for the instructor in instructors form. More often, you are doing something with the numbers that requires them to be integers, e.g. math. sum = 0 for i in range ( 10 ): sum += i print ( sum ) 45 Before we leave the topic of range() , let's take a quick look at the documentation for it here . Notice, it has another calling semantic than the one have have been using. We have been using this version: range(stop) Where the list will end at stop minus 1. There is another way the range function can be called which is to give it an inclusive start and an exclusive stop : range(start, stop) This returns a list of number that go from start to stop minus 1. Let's look at a quick example: range(1, 9) range ( 1 , 9 ) range(1, 9) 2.2.2.3 Nested for loops \u00b6 You can put a for loop inside another for loop. This is called nesting . Think of it like the Matryoshka dolls . The example below has a nested loop that counts to four each time the outer loop counts up one. The print function shows the value of the outside loop iterator i and the inside loop iterator j and the product of the two values. Notice how the inside loop runs through 1 to 3 for each value of the outside loop. We use some string formatting for the print statement. These are called f-strings because there is an f before the string. Don't worry too much about the print function statement here as it isn't the point of this example. Advanced topic : for more on formatting strings, see here . for i in range(1, 4): for j in range(1, 4): print(f'{i} * {j} = {i * j}') for i in range ( 1 , 4 ): for j in range ( 1 , 4 ): print ( f ' { i } * { j } = { i * j } ' ) 1 * 1 = 1 1 * 2 = 2 1 * 3 = 3 2 * 1 = 2 2 * 2 = 4 2 * 3 = 6 3 * 1 = 3 3 * 2 = 6 3 * 3 = 9 2.2.2.4 Exiting for loops \u00b6 You can exit a for loop if a condition is met. We'll explore this with reserved words break and continue 2.2.2.4.1 break \u00b6 Sometimes, in a for loop, you experience a condition where you want to terminate any further iterations of the loop. The reserved word break will completely exit a for loop. In this example, we exit the for loop when the iteration variable i is equal to the integer 4. for i in range(10): if i == 4: break i for i in range ( 10 ): if i == 4 : break i 4 2.2.2.4 continue \u00b6 Sometimes, in a for loop, you want to skip certain elements. The continue statement will effectively skip any further statements for that element in a list. Below, we sum the numbers from 0 to 9 and skip the value 5 . sum = 0 for i in range(10): if i == 5: continue else: print(i) sum += i print(\"sum is \", sum) for i in range ( 6 ): if i == 3 : continue else : print ( i ) 0 1 2 4 5 2.2.3 while \u00b6 In contrast to a for loop, a while loop continues to execute while the initiating condition continues to evaluate as True. a = 0 while a < 10 : a += 5 print ( \"hello!\" ) a hello! hello! 10 You can also use break and continue in while loops while True : print ( \"hello!\" ) break hello! \ud83d\ude4b Question 2: While Loops \u00b6 What happens in this cell? a = 0 while a < 10: if a == 5: continue a += 5 print(\"hello!\") # a = 0 # while a < 10: # if a == 5: # continue # a += 5 # print(\"hello!\") # a 2.3 The Zen of Python \u00b6 Finally, let's use end with a philosophy of Python. This is a fun Easter Egg , to see it, import this : import this The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity. Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. Now is better than never. Although never is often better than *right* now. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! 2.4 References \u00b6 Some links to references from content in this notebook are consolidated here for easy access. Enjoy!

In fact, they may contain a few to many pieces of data rolled into one thing or data structure . Next, we'll discuss two important data structures : lists and dictionaries . There are many advanced data structures in Python that behave like lists and dictionaries , in different settings but their concepts are often similar. Thus, understanding them here will help us understand more advanced concepts. Let's start with the venerable list .","title":"2.1 Data Structures: Variables that organize data"},{"location":"S2_Data_Structures_and_Flow/#211-lists","text":"For more than just shopping. A list is an ordered collection of data. By collection , we mean that it contains multiple data. By ordered , we mean that the data are arranged so that they appear first to last like words in a sentence. The order is important for the meaning of the sentence. Let's begin by creating a list variable named my_list that contains three pieces of information. my_list = ['I', 'like', 'pie'] my_list my_list = [ 'I' , 'like' , 'pie' ] my_list ['I', 'like', 'pie'] Now the value of the variable my_list points to a list of three strings. The use of [ , ] , and , are used to denote the begining, end and separator of the list. Like a sentence, this list of words is ordered. I like pie. Notice, we didn't use a print() on the variable. The last variable expression in a cell is shown in the notebook by default. The elements in a list have indices. That is, to access an element in the list, you can refer to it by its index. Think of a list like a very simple table. index value 0 'I' 1 'like' 2 'pie' People might start counting at 1 , but computers start counting at 0 . The first element in a list has the index 0 , the last element in a list has the index of the length of the list minus 1. For our list which is three elements long, the first index will be 0 and the last index will be 2 . Some programming languages also start counting at 1. These include Fortran , Matlab , and the abominable R . This is unfortunate. Be extra careful if you try to port code from those languages to Python. If you want to access a list element you can use its index. The index value is designated by appending [ and ] to the variable name with the index between. Examples are always easier than words: my_list[0] Given what you know... What will this output? my_list [ 0 ] 'I' If you try to use an index that is larger than the length of the list minus 1, you will get an error. Try it! The different colors means you made a boo boo! my_list[3] # my_list[3] The last line of the error report is the most informative for us now. It should read: IndexError: list index out of range It is trying to tell you that an IndexError occured because the the index you tried to access is out of the range of 0 to 2 , inclusive. Translation: stay in your lane, programmer! In addition to being able to recall or access a value of a list by the element's index in the list, we can change the value of the element. We will also use the [ <index> ] notation but like when we set the value of a variable, we will use the = character.

An empty list is created by setting a variable to [] . This means the variable's data type is a list, but it contains no elements. a_new_list = [] a_new_list = [] We can append items to a list by using the .append() function . We'll talk more about functions later, but when this function or method is used on a variable whose data type is list, it will append the value in between the () to the end of the list. a_new_list.append(\"1st element\") print(a_new_list) a_new_list.append(\"2nd element\") print(a_new_list) a_new_list . append ( \"1st element\" ) print ( a_new_list ) a_new_list . append ( \"2nd element\" ) print ( a_new_list ) ['1st element'] ['1st element', '2nd element'] Finally, in addition to the .append() function , there are a lot of functions (or methods ) available for lists .

This is called slicing where you cut up a list and get just the consecutive values you want. Slicing is done with the : character in the index area between the [ and the ] . Here is an example to pull just the last two items out of my_list . We use the first index, then a : , then the last index plus 1. Like this: my_list[1:3] You might be asking... WHY +1?? This is because with slices or ranges in Python are known as half-open intervals where the lower bound is inclusive and the upper bound is the non-inclusive limit. TL;DR : add one to the upper end of a slice or a range in Python. my_list[1:3] my_list [ 1 : 3 ] ['like', 'cake'] Just for giggles, try it with my_list[1:2] . You will see the range of the slice is only 1 . That's because 2 - 1 = 1 . my_list[1:2] my_list [ 1 : 2 ] ['like'] You don't even need to use the upper bound if all you really mean is the end of the list . For that, you can leave the index empty. Hot dog! Let's see an example... my_list[1:] my_list [ 1 :] ['like', 'cake'] But wait, there's more! You can set multiple elements of a list at the same time by slicing . Dig this! my_list[1:] = ['love', 'puppies'] my_list my_list [ 1 :] = [ 'love' , 'puppies' ] my_list ['I', 'love', 'puppies'] And who doesn't love puppies? Recap... Lists are ordered collections of information that you can recognize by their use of [ and ] . To access or address elements in the list, you can use indices . They start at 0 in Python. The last element of a list has the index of the length of the list minus 1. When slicing a list, use two indices separated by : .

The same rules apply for slicing with the : character. A quick demo example... Let's get last element in the list using negative indexing. That will be -1 . Here goes... my_list[-1] my_list [ - 1 ] 'puppies' We can also use slicing with negative indices . Remember, that slicing works the same way with negative indices , i.e. the the upper bound is non-inclusive. Here is an example using upper and lower bounds.

Sometimes we want to access elements in a data structure by something other than an index. Consider a dictionary on the internet . You look up the word on a seach engine and go to the web page of the entry for the word.

This results in key and value pairs. One key maps to one value . In our analogy of a internet dictionary, this is the same as the word to definition pairs. Let's create a simple dictionary with a definition we have alread seen in the tutorials... Pickles. my_dict = {} # create an empty dictionary my_dict['pickles'] = \"A cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.\" my_dict my_dict = {} # create an empty dictionary my_dict [ 'pickles' ] = \"A cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.\" my_dict {'pickles': 'A cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.'} Notice the use of the # comment. Nice. Unlike the list, for dictionaries, some of their operations use the { and } brackets. Using a key to access or retrieve a value from the dictionary still uses the [ and ] brackets. Stick with it, for realz. Case matters in a dictionary because the key is a data type itself. my_dict['Pickles'] returns an error ( KeyError: 'Pickles' ) and the following does not my_dict['pickles'] # my_dict['Pickles'] This is a lot like the IndexError from the list case. Moving on... You can change the value of a dictionary key by reassigning it. For example below, we use the same key 'pickles' to change the definition of the word in our dictionary. Notice we still use the [ and ] brackets but we use the key instead of the index like we did with lists. The change we made in the string is that the cucumbers in pickles are usually small. my_dict['pickles'] = \"A small cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.\" my_dict [ 'pickles' ] = \"A small cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.\" my_dict {'pickles': 'A small cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.'} Let's add two key and value pairs to our dictionary which are in the table below: key value list An ordered collection. dictionary A collection with unique indices . Something like: my_dict['list'] = \"An ordered collection\" print(my_dict) Is probably where we want to begin. my_dict [ 'list' ] = \"An ordered collection\" my_dict {'list': 'An ordered collection', 'pickles': 'A small cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.'} # my_dict[0] Finally, like the list's .append() function , there are a lot of functions (or methods ) and attributes available for dictionaries.

The use of pass here is very important. While you can actually skip the else and pass statements and the code will behave identically, using them is an important signal that you intended for the negative case to do nothing. Most of the time when pass is used, it is used as a placeholder for an eventual action/function/loop to be filled in. By using pass, we signal this intention . As a side note, I personally have felt the pangs of conditional fall through. Had I used the else/pass nomenclature, I would have signalled to myself that at some point in the future, I needed to explicitly account for when a specific execution of the code passes through this condition. Because I was not tabulating this conditional fall through, unbeknownst to me code I had productionized, was in fact not working exactly the way I intended it to.

We've seen them previously and used them, for example the .append() function for lists, or the even more general print() function. Here, we'll dig into how you can make your own functions to encapsulate code that you will reuse over and over. 3.0 Review from Session on Data Structures and Flow Control \u00b6 In our last session, we discussed lists , dictionaries , and flow control . Lists are ordered collections of data that can be used to hold multiple pieces of information while preserving their order. We use [ and ] to access elements by their indices which start with 0 . All things that operate on lists like slices use the concept of an inclusive lower bound and an exclusive upper bound. So, the following gets elements from the list my_list with index values of 0 , 1 , and 2 , but not 3 ! my_list[0:3] \ud83d\ude4b Question 1: Slicing \u00b6 What other way is there of writing the same statement using slicing ? Hint, think about leaving out one of the numbers in the slice! Dictionaries are named collections of data that can be used to hold multiple pieces of information as values that are addressed by keys resulting in a key to value data structure. They are accessed with [ and ] but intialized with { and } . E.g. my_dict = { 'cake' : 'Tasty!', 'toenails' : 'Gross!' } my_dict['cake'] Finally, we talked about flow control and using the concept of conditional execution to decide which code statements were executed. Remember this figure? Flow control figure What are the if statments? Where do for loops fit in? 3.1 Functions \u00b6 For loops let you repeat some code for every item in a list. Functions are similar in that they run the same lines of code and, frequently, for new values of some variable (we call these parameters ). They are different in that functions are not limited to looping over items. Functions are a critical part of writing easy to read, reusable code. Create a function like: def function_name (parameters): \"\"\" optional docstring \"\"\" function expressions return [variable] Here is a simple example. It prints a string that was passed in and returns nothing. def print_string(string): \"\"\"This prints out a string passed as the parameter.\"\"\" print(string) return def print_string ( string ): \"\"\"This prints out a string passed as the parameter\"\"\" print ( string ) return To call the function, use: print_string(\"GIX is awesome!\") Note: The function has to be defined before you can call it! print_string ( \"GIX is awesome!\" ) GIX is awesome! 3.1.1 Reserved words: def, return, and yield \u00b6 Notice the highlighted words in our function definition: def and return these are reserved words in python used to define functions. Every function definition requires these reserved words. yield is another reserved word that is similar to return but operates slightly differently. It is beyond the scope of what we are covering in this session. This tutorial from realpython has good information on the topic. # what is return doing in this function? def my_square ( a ): return a ** 2 return is going to output whatever value(s) follow after the keyword return when we call upon our function a = 2 my_square ( a ) 4 I'm going to return two values... def my_square ( a ): return a ** 2 , a and we see how the output updates accordingly my_square ( a ) (4, 2) We can capture these values on the output with... square , new_a = my_square ( a ) print ( square , new_a ) 4 2 3.1.2 Global vs local variables and function parameters \u00b6 In a function, new variables that you create are not saved when the function returns - these are local variables. Variables defined outside of the function can be accessed but not changed - these are global variables. let's define the following function def my_little_func ( a ): b = 10 return a * b my_little_func ( 2 ) 20 if I run the following... # b Let's play with this a little further... ...now let's define b outside the function and call our function with a=5 # what happens here? b = 100 my_little_func ( 5 ) 50 we see that b is still 100, instead of 10 as its defined within the function. This is because b inside of my_little_func is a local variable. it doesn't matter how I define b outside the function because within the function it is set locally. ... Let's do this A LITTLE MORE def my_new_func ( a ): print ( b ) return a * b now if I call on my new function, because b is not defined locally within the function, it takes on the global value. This is typically not happy-happy fun-fun behavior for us: we want to be explicit about how we define and use our variables (but there are some times when this is appropriate to do) b = 1e4 # side note, what did I do here???? my_new_func ( a ) 10000.0 20000.0 3.1.1.1 Function Parameters \u00b6 Parameters (or arguments) in Python are all passed by reference. This means that if you modify the parameters in the function, they are modified outside of the function (enrichment topic: there are exceptions, see below). See the following example: def change_list(my_list): \"\"\"This changes a passed list into this function\"\"\" my_list.append('four'); print('list inside the function: ', my_list) return my_list = [1, 2, 3]; print('list before the function: ', my_list) change_list(my_list); print('list after the function: ', my_list) def change_list ( my_list ): \"\"\"This changes a passed list into this function\"\"\" my_list . append ( 'four' ); print ( 'list inside the function: ' , my_list ) return my_list = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]; print ( 'list before the function: ' , my_list ) change_list ( my_list ); print ( 'list after the function: ' , my_list ) list before the function: [1, 2, 3] list inside the function: [1, 2, 3, 'four'] list after the function: [1, 2, 3, 'four'] \ud83c\udf52 3.1.1.2 Enrichment: Global, local, and immutables \u00b6 Let's go back to our former example... Keep in mind the following immutables: integers, float, str, tuples and now one-by-one uncomment lines 2-5; what is happening here!? b = \"a string\" # b = 10 # b = 10.2 # b = (10, 2) # b = [10, 2] def my_little_func ( b ): if type ( b ) == str : b += \"20\" elif ( type ( b ) == int ) or ( type ( b ) == float ): b += 10 elif ( type ( b ) == tuple ): print ( \"AYYY no tuple changes, Dude\" ) pass elif ( type ( b ) == list ): b . append ( 'whoaaaa' ) print ( b ) return print ( b ) my_little_func ( b ) print ( b ) a string a string20 a string There is a way to change a global variable within a function with the global keyword. Generally, the use of global variables is not encouraged, instead use parameters. We won't cover the global keyword here but you can explore further on your own if you are interested. \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 1: My first function \u00b6 Write a function that takes one parameter and returns any data structure If you are going to return multiple objects, what data structure that we talked about can be used? Give an example below. # Cell for excerise 1 3.1.3 Parameter types \u00b6 We will now discuss the different parameter types. Function calling: In function calling we have positional and keyword parameters positional func(10, 20) keyword func(a=10, b=20) or func(b=20, a=10) Function writing: In funciton writing we can specify default values for parameters default def func(a=10, b=20) def print_name(first, last='Beckner'): print(f'Your name is {first} {last}') return def print_name ( first , last = 'Beckner' ): print ( \"Your name is {} {} \" . format ( first , last )) return print_name ( last = 'Beckner' , first = 'Wesley' ) Your name is Wesley Beckner Play around with the above function. print_name ( 'Wesley' , last = 'the Python Foundations Instructor' ) Your name is Wesley the Python Foundations Instructor Functions can contain any code that you put anywhere else including: * if ... elif ... else * for ... while * other function calls def print_name_age(first, last, age): print_name(first, last) print('Your age is %d' % (age)) if age > 25 and age < 40: print('You are a millenial!') return def print_name_age ( first , last , age ): print_name ( first , last ) print ( 'Your age is %d ' % ( age )) if age > 25 and age < 40 : print ( 'You are a millenial!' ) return print_name_age(age=29, last='Beckner', first='Wesley') print_name_age ( age = 29 , last = 'Beckner' , first = 'Wesley' ) Your name is Wesley Beckner Your age is 29 You are a millenial! 3.2 The scientific python stack \u00b6 In addition to Python's built-in modules like the math module we explored previously, there are also many often-used third-party modules that are core tools for doing data science with Python. Some of the most important ones are: numpy : Numerical Python \u00b6 Numpy is short for \"Numerical Python\", and contains tools for efficient manipulation of arrays of data. If you have used other computational tools like IDL or MatLab, Numpy should feel very familiar. scipy : Scientific Python \u00b6 Scipy is short for \"Scientific Python\", and contains a wide range of functionality for accomplishing common scientific tasks, such as optimization/minimization, numerical integration, interpolation, and much more. We will not look closely at Scipy today, but we will use its functionality later in the course. pandas : Labeled Data Manipulation in Python \u00b6 Pandas is short for \"Panel Data\", and contains tools for doing more advanced manipulation of labeled data in Python, in particular with a columnar data structure called a Data Frame . If you've used the R statistical language (and in particular the so-called \"Hadley Stack\"), much of the functionality in Pandas should feel very familiar. matplotlib : Visualization in Python \u00b6 Matplotlib started out as a Matlab plotting clone in Python, and has grown from there in the 15 years since its creation. It is the most popular data visualization tool currently in the Python data world (though other recent packages are starting to encroach on its monopoly). scikit-learn : Machine Learning in Python \u00b6 Scikit-learn is a machine learning library. It features various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms, including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means, and DBSCAN. The library is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy. 3.3 Debugging \u00b6 On to Debugging! It\u2019s always important to check that our code is \u201cplugged in\u201d, i.e., that we\u2019re actually exercising the problem that we think we are. Every programmer has spent hours chasing a bug, only to realize that they were actually calling their code on the wrong dataset or with the wrong configuration parameters, or are using the wrong version of the software entirely. Mistakes like these are particularly likely to happen when we\u2019re tired, frustrated, and up against a deadline, which is one of the reasons late-night (or overnight) coding sessions are almost never worthwhile. - swcarpentry We'll now dedicate some discussion and practice to debugging in python. This easy to overlook topic can save us oodles of time down the road. It's worth the investment. Borrowing from software carpentry, we'll highlight the key guidlines to debugging code: Know what it's supposed to do Make it fail every time Make it fail fast Change one thing at a time, for a reason Keep track of what you've done Be humble 3.3.0 Before We Get Started \u00b6 We will refer to writing tests, and specifically writing unit tests in this module. Don't worry too much about the specifics of unit tests for now. We will have a dedicated module for that. What we do need to talk about is a specific built in function in python called the assert function 3.3.0.1 the assert function \u00b6 Let's take a simple example of the assert function. If I wanted to test that the sum of two numbers is correct I would write: assert sum ([ 2 , 5 ]) == 7 , \"should be 7\" Nothing is sent to the print out because the condition is satisfied. If we run, however: assert sum([2, 4]) == 7, \"should be 7\" we get an error message: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- AssertionError Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-3-d5724b127818> in <module>() ----> 1 assert sum([2, 4]) == 7, \"should be 7\" AssertionError: should be 7 Now to make this a test, you will want to wrap it in a function def test_sum (): assert sum ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) == 6 , \"Should be 6\" test_sum () print ( \"Everything passed\" ) Everything passed And if we include a test that does not pass: def test_sum(): assert sum([3, 3]) == 6, \"Should be 6\" def test_my_broken_func(): assert sum([1, 2]) == 5, \"Should be 5\" test_sum() test_my_broken_func() print(\"Everything passed\") Here our test fails, because the sum of 1 and 2 is 3 and not 5. We get a traceback that tells us the source of the error: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- AssertionError Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-13-8a552fbf52bd> in <module>() 6 7 test_sum() ----> 8 test_my_broken_func() 9 print(\"Everything passed\") <ipython-input-13-8a552fbf52bd> in test_my_broken_func() 3 4 def test_my_broken_func(): ----> 5 assert sum([1, 2]) == 5, \"Should be 5\" 6 7 test_sum() AssertionError: Should be 5 We will worry about the intricacies of what to test and when to test it at a later time. For now, we just need to understand the assert function so we can practice debugging and writing short tests for the problems that we fix today! Ok LETS GO 3.3.1 Know what it's supposed to do \u00b6 This may seem obvious, but it's easy to recognize that an error is happening without knowing what the correct answer is. This makes unit tests especially handy, they force us to know the expected outcome at least for intended use cases. Here are some tips in regard to knowing the expected outcome: test with simplified data test a simplified case compare to a base model visualize 3.3.2 Make it fail every time \u00b6 It can be extraordinarily difficult to debug code that is precidated on some stochastic process. remove stochasticity when possible . For instance, seed your random value generators ( random.seed() , np.random.seed() ) 3.3.3 Make it fail fast \u00b6 a corrolary to this, is narrow down the source of the error, and again this is why we write unit tests before integration tests. If it takes 20 minutes to train your neural network, and the error occurs during some post processing plotting of your loss history, obviously don't retrain the NN each time you iterate over the failure. Along the same lines, if you're debugging something in a for loop, run the loop once, or run the indented code outside of the loop with a placeholder for the iterated variable, in order to test and debug the code. 3.3.4 Change one thing at a time, for a reason \u00b6 Not much nuance here. Just like it's a good idea for us to change one aspect of our machine learning models and track the performance rather than to change multiple things at once, it's better to change one feature when debugging at a time. Changing multiple things at once creates interaction effects that can complicate the whole problem! 3.3.5 Keep track of what you've done \u00b6 This is where git/GitHub come in handy. It's so incredibly easy to forget what you've done, and, a weeks or days later from the time you first encountered the bug, forget whether you fixed it, did a temp fix, and/or what you did to fix it. my tip: if you're working in a jupyter notebook, something I do is write at the top of my notebook my TO DO items. I then strike through items I complete, and update my notes for the next time I work on the code. Similarly, I name my notebooks to reflect and categorize what they are about. Primarily I have test_<thing>.ipynb and prototype_<thingy>.ipynb 3.3.6 Be humble \u00b6 Lastly, ask for help. Take breaks. A week of hard work can sometimes save you an hour of thought. \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 2: Debug A Short Code Block \u00b6 Your friend is writing a function to calculate BMI. They are concerned that seemingly all the patient's values have the same BMI, despite having different heights and weights. Determine the bugs in the code then write a unit test for the function calculate_bmi . # [weight (kg), height (m)] patients = [[ 70 , 1.8 ], [ 80 , 1.9 ], [ 150 , 1.7 ]] def calculate_bmi ( weight , height ): # kg / m ** 2 = bmi return weight / ( height ** 2 ) for patient in patients : weight , height = patients [ 0 ] bmi = calculate_bmi ( height , weight ) print ( \"Patient's BMI is: %f \" % bmi ) Patient's BMI is: 0.000367 Patient's BMI is: 0.000367 Patient's BMI is: 0.000367 def test_calculate_bmi (): patients = [[ 70 , 1.8 ], [ 80 , 1.9 ], [ 150 , 1.7 ]] bmis = [ 21.6 , 22.16 , 51.9 ] pass test_calculate_bmi () print ( \"success!\" ) success!","title":"Functions and Debugging"},{"location":"S3_Functions_and_Debugging/#python-foundations-session-3-functions-and-debugging","text":"Instructor : Wesley Beckner Contact : wesleybeckner@gmail.com Recording : Video (32 min) special thanks to David Beck for their contribution to this material Today, we will discuss functions in more depth.

In other words, when the object is declared, it will refer to that specific object in memory and not all instances of the class in question. This is yet another pythonic way of being explicit. what is the special keyword self doing, do we really need it? Read more about the philosophy of the self by visiting the link! Let's practice class declaration now, in the context of Pokeballs We have a lot of different kinds of Poke balls! This is going to help us understand some of the powerful mechanisms inherit in python classes! Let's start by defining a class to describe the simple, standard Poke ball. It will have the following attributes: contains the name of the pokemon contained in the Poke ball. Default value is None type_name the type of Poke ball. Default value is \"Poke ball\" catch_rate the probability of a successful catch upon throwing the Poke ball. The default value is 0.5 and the user will not be able to set the value of this object. Let's take a look at how we do this: # define the class in the standard way via the reserved word class class Pokeball : # define the init method pass in the \"self\" and any attributes that will # be definable upon initialization of the object def __init__ ( self , contains = None , type_name = \"Poke ball\" ): # now set the attributes of the object via the self self . contains = contains self . type_name = type_name self . catch_rate = 0.50 # note this attribute is not accessible upon init # empty Poke ball pokeball1 = Pokeball () # used Poke ball of a different type pokeball1 = Pokeball ( \"Pikachu\" , \"Master ball\" ) \ud83d\ude4b Question 1: What are the parameters of Pokeball ? \u00b6 Note that, were we to run the following cell, we would get an error. Why would we get an error? # Pokeball(\"Charmander\", \"Poke ball\", catch_rate=0.5) classes can also contain methods. I'm going to introduce a new method catch that is used to catch new pokemon. It will have a random chance of success and, additionally, it will only work if the Poke ball is empty. import random class Pokeball : def __init__ ( self , contains = None , type_name = \"Poke ball\" ): self . contains = contains self . type_name = type_name self . catch_rate = 0.50 # note this attribute is not accessible upon init # the method catch, will update self.contains, if a catch is successful # it will also use self.catch_rate to set the performance of the catch def catch ( self , pokemon ): if self . contains == None : if random . random () < self . catch_rate : self . contains = pokemon print ( f \" { pokemon } captured!\" ) else : print ( f \" { pokemon } escaped!\" ) pass else : print ( \"Poke ball is not empty!\" ) We can envoke the catch method the same way we would return the attribute of an object - by running <object>.method() . Note that, because this is a method, we must use () , the same way we use () with functions. Inside the () we pass any necessary parameters. In this case we will pass the name of the Pokemon we are trying to catch: pokeball = Pokeball () pokeball . catch ( \"picachu\" ) picachu captured! print ( pokeball . contains ) picachu \ud83d\ude4b Question 2: How does catch_rate work? \u00b6 How often will success print to the output when we run the cell below? if random . random () < 0.5 : # here I've replaced catch_rate with the hardcoded value 0.5 print ( 'success' ) \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 1: Write a Method \u00b6 Create a release method for the class Pokeball: # Cell for Exercise 1 import random class Pokeball : def __init__ ( self , contains = None , type_name = \"Poke ball\" ): self . contains = contains self . type_name = type_name self . catch_rate = 0.50 # note this attribute is not accessible upon init def catch ( self , pokemon ): \"\"\" Used to catch Pokemon with an empty Poke ball.

We inherit a parent class by passing it into the child class: # Pokeball is the parent class and Masterball is the child class class Masterball ( Pokeball ): pass Once we declare an object of the child class. We will have access to all of the parent class attributes. In this case, masterball will inherit the type_name of \"Poke ball\" from the Pokeball class: masterball = Masterball () masterball . type_name 'Poke ball' HMMM we don't like that type name because this is not a regular-old Poke ball anymore. It is a Master ball! Let's make sure we change some of the inherited attributes. We'll do this again with the __init__ function # we still pass Pokeball into Masterball class Masterball ( Pokeball ): # now we pass into the init method the class attribute values we actually # desire, instead of just inheriting them from the parent class def __init__ ( self , contains = None , type_name = \"Masterball\" , catch_rate = 0.8 ): self . contains = contains self . type_name = type_name self . catch_rate = catch_rate masterball = Masterball () masterball . type_name 'Masterball' masterball . catch ( \"charmander\" ) charmander captured! We can also write this, this way: class Masterball ( Pokeball ): def __init__ ( self , contains = None , type_name = \"Masterball\" ): # instead of rewriting all of the self.<attribute> commands, we can access # the init method from the parent class (where those commands are already # declared) Pokeball . __init__ ( self , contains , type_name ) self . catch_rate = 0.8 masterball = Masterball () masterball . type_name 'Masterball' masterball = Masterball () masterball . catch ( \"charmander\" ) charmander captured! The keyword super will let us write even more succintly: class Masterball ( Pokeball ): def __init__ ( self , contains = None , type_name = \"Masterball\" ): # super() is taking the namespace of the parent class, note that with this # mechanism we no longer have to pass in the self attribute super () . __init__ ( contains , type_name ) self . catch_rate = 0.8 masterball = Masterball () masterball . catch ( \"charmander\" ) charmander captured! \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 2: Create a Class \u00b6 Write another class object called GreatBall that inherits the properties of Pokeball , has a catch_rate of 0.6, and type_name of Greatball # Cell for Exercise 2 4.1.3 Interacting Objects \u00b6 As our application becomes more complex, we may have to rethink what methods and attributes are appropriate for our objects to deliver the overall functionality we desire.

Packages are collections of related functions. These are the things we import . Pandas operates around a two dimensional data structure called a DataFrame, much like a spreadsheet in Excel. We will be importing our first dataset and viewing it, with Pandas! 5.1 Pandas \u00b6 5.1.1 Pandas and Scikit-Learn load_datasets \u00b6 We begin by loading the Pandas package. Packages are collections of functions that share a common utility. We've seen import before. Let's use it to import Pandas and all the richness that Pandas has. We'll also use a very useful feature of the scikit-learn toolkit, the load_datasets module. We will do some very rudimentary tasks with this dataset, just to demonstrate the utility of load_datasets , then we will switch over to a more relevant dataset for our purposes. import pandas from sklearn.datasets import load_wine import pandas from sklearn.datasets import load_wine We import a function load_wine that loads a simple data set we can play with called the Wine recognition dataset from the 1980s. You can read more about that dataset here dataset = load_wine() print(dataset.DESCR) dataset = load_wine () print ( dataset .

You can think of it as like an Excel spreadsheet. Let's create an empty DataFrame and put the result into a variable called df . This is a popular choice for a DataFrame variable name. df = pd.DataFrame() df = pd . DataFrame () Let's open the Wine dataset as a pandas DataFrame. Notice we change the value of the df variable to point to a new DataFrame. df = pd.DataFrame(dataset.data, columns=dataset.feature_names) df = pd . DataFrame ( dataset . data , columns = dataset . feature_names ) 5.1.2.1 From excel and csv \u00b6 We will now be reading the data from this link . This is what we call a csv or comma separated value file. We have a method to read these directly into pandas: df = pd . read_csv ( 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wesleybeckner/technology_explorers/main/assets/imdb_movies.csv' ) C:\\Users\\WesleyBeckner\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ipykernel_17180\\2664770703.py:1: DtypeWarning: Columns (3) have mixed types.

Here we'll look at value counts and the basics of group-by operations. # a basic select, filter, operate procedure would look like: df [ df [ 'country' ] == 'USA' ][ 'duration' ] . describe () count 28511.000000 mean 93.050437 std 18.576873 min 42.000000 25% 84.000000 50% 91.000000 75% 100.000000 max 398.000000 Name: duration, dtype: float64 we can invert the selection with ~ df [ ~ ( df [ 'country' ] == 'USA' )][ 'duration' ] . describe () count 57344.000000 mean 103.981410 std 23.459158 min 41.000000 25% 90.000000 50% 99.000000 75% 112.000000 max 808.000000 Name: duration, dtype: float64 In preparation for grouping the data, let's bin the instances by their duration (we could have chosen any numerical column). For that, we'll use pd.cut . The documentation for pd.cut can be found here . It is used to bin values into discrete intervals. This is like a histogram where for each bin along the range of data values, you count the number of occurrences of that bin. in our example, we'll use 10 bins and let Pandas decide how to evenly divide the range into the bins. Let's see it in action. df['duration_group'] = pd.cut(df['duration'], 10) df.head() df.dtypes df [ 'duration_group' ] = pd . cut ( df [ 'duration' ], 10 ) df . head () .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } imdb_title_id title original_title year date_published genre duration country language director writer production_company actors description avg_vote votes budget usa_gross_income worlwide_gross_income metascore reviews_from_users reviews_from_critics duration (hours) duration_group 0 tt0000009 Miss Jerry Miss Jerry 1894 1894-10-09 Romance 45 USA None Alexander Black Alexander Black Alexander Black Photoplays Blanche Bayliss, William Courtenay, Chauncey D...

We'll take a look at two of these here. The pandas.value_counts returns statistics on the unique values within each column. We can use it, for example, to break down the movies by their duration group that we just created: pd.value_counts(df['duration_group'], sort=False) pd . value_counts ( df [ 'duration_group' ], sort = False ) (40.233, 117.7] 72368 (117.7, 194.4] 13197 (194.4, 271.1] 228 (271.1, 347.8] 40 (347.8, 424.5] 11 (424.5, 501.2] 4 (501.2, 577.9] 4 (577.9, 654.6] 1 (654.6, 731.3] 1 (731.3, 808.0] 1 Name: duration_group, dtype: int64 What happens if we try this on a continuous valued variable? pd.value_counts(df['duration']) pd . value_counts ( df [ 'duration' ]) 90 5162 95 3194 100 3106 92 2418 93 2414 ... 279 1 301 1 345 1 729 1 319 1 Name: duration, Length: 266, dtype: int64 \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 5: value_counts, unique, nunique \u00b6 We can do a little data exploration with this by seeing how common different values are. Play around with these pandas methods: value_counts() unique() nunique() Also be sure to use: selection filteration (and you are already using operation with the above mentioned pandas methods, value_counts, unique, nunique (: ) Do so with 3 different columns in the dataframe # Cell for Exercise 5 5.1.4.4 Group-by Operation \u00b6 One of the killer features of the Pandas dataframe is the ability to do group-by operations. You can visualize the group-by like this (image borrowed from the Python Data Science Handbook ) 5.1.4.5 Summary statistics with groupby: value_counts , count , describe \u00b6 Let's break take this in smaller steps. Recall our duration_group column. pd.value_counts(df['duration_group']) pd . value_counts ( df [ 'duration_group' ]) (40.233, 117.7] 72368 (117.7, 194.4] 13197 (194.4, 271.1] 228 (271.1, 347.8] 40 (347.8, 424.5] 11 (501.2, 577.9] 4 (424.5, 501.2] 4 (731.3, 808.0] 1 (654.6, 731.3] 1 (577.9, 654.6] 1 Name: duration_group, dtype: int64 groupby allows us to look at the number of values for each column and each value.

And, more specifically, how we can manipulate our pandas dataframes to give us the visualizations we desire. Before we get there, however, we're going to start by introducing a python module called Matplotlib. 6.1 Visualization with Matplotlib \u00b6 Lets start by importing our matplotlib module. Pyplot is a module of Matplotlib that provides functions to add plot elements like text, lines, and images. Typically we import this module like so import matplotlib.pyplot as plt where plt is shorthand for the matplotlib.pyplot library import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 6.1.1 The Basics \u00b6 Matplotlib is strongly object oriented and its principal objects are the figure and the axes . But before we get into that I want us to explore the most basic use case. In this basic use case, we don't declare the figure and axes objects explicitly, but rather work directly in the pyplot namespace. I'l demonstrate to show what I mean here. I'm going to create a list of x and y values and plot them with pyplot x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] y = [1,1,2,3,5,8,13] plt.plot(x,y) x = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] y = [ 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 ] plt . plot ( x , y ) [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x22a7cd340d0>] \ud83d\ude4b Question 1 \u00b6 What do we think about the out-of-the-box formatting of pyplot ? What are some things we can do to make it better? Could we make it bigger? Perhaps different dimensions? Does anyone recognize that default line color? Before we make any changes, let's become acquianted with the more appropriate way to work in matplotlib.pyplot . In this formality, we explicitly create our figure and axes objects. You can think of the figure as a canvas, where you specify dimensions and possibly unifying attributes of its contents, like, background color, border, etc. You use the canvas, the figure , to containerize your other objects, primarily your axes , and to save its contents with savefig . You can think of an axes as the actual graphs or plots themselves. And when we declare these objects, we have access to all the methods of matplotlib.pyplot (e.g. .plot , .scatter , .hist etc.) You can place many of these axes into the figure container in a variety of ways. The last component of a pyplot figure are the axis , the graphical axis we typically think of. plt.subplots returns a figure and axes object(s) together: ### We can create the figure (fig) and axes (ax) in a single line fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(8,8)) and we'll go ahead and adjust the figure size with the parameter figsize and set it equal to a tuple containing the x and y dimensions of the figure in inches. # We can create the figure (fig) and axes (ax) in a single line fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 5 )) To recap, by convention we typically separate our plots into three components: a Figure, its Axes, and their Axis: Figure : It is a whole figure which may contain one or more than one axes (plots). You can think of a figure as a canvas which contains plots. Axes : It is what we generally think of as a plot. A figure can contain many axes . It contains two or three (in the case of 3D) axis objects. Each axes has a title, an x-label and a y-label. Axis : They are the traditional axis we think of in a graph and take care of generating the graph limits. Example: fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(8,8)) is creating the figure ( fig ) and axes ( ax ) explicitly, and depending on whether we create 2D or 3D plots, the axes will contain 2-3 axis . \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 1: Adjust Figure Size \u00b6 create a figure and axes using plt.subplots() . adjust the figure size to be 6 inches (width) by 3 inches (height). Plot the values of the fibonacci sequence we defined earlier (Bonus) Repeat, this time inverting the y-values using list splicing (Bonus) Explore other plt.plot() attributes using the built in Colab tooltip Plotting building blocks for Exercise 1: * plt.subplots() * ax.plot() * slicing [::] x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] y = [1,1,2,3,5,8,13] # Cell for Exercise 1 x = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] y = [ 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 ] 6.1.2 Manipulating Plot Attributes \u00b6 We can manipulate many parameters of a figure 's axes : marker , linestyle , and color , to name a few. Each of these parameters takes string values. fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=(5,5)) ax.plot([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[1,1,2,3,5,8,13], marker='^', linestyle='--', color='tab:blue') ax.plot([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[0,3,8,6,5,4,1], marker='.', linestyle='-.', color='#59A41F') ax.set_title('My Random Values') ax.set_xlabel('Order in Sequence') ax.set_ylabel('Value') List of marker styles {'': 'nothing', ' ': 'nothing', '*': 'star', '+': 'plus', ',': 'pixel', '.': 'point', 0: 'tickleft', '1': 'tri_down', 1: 'tickright', 10: 'caretupbase', 11: 'caretdownbase', '2': 'tri_up', 2: 'tickup', '3': 'tri_left', 3: 'tickdown', '4': 'tri_right', 4: 'caretleft', 5: 'caretright', 6: 'caretup', 7: 'caretdown', '8': 'octagon', 8: 'caretleftbase', 9: 'caretrightbase', '<': 'triangle_left', '>': 'triangle_right', 'D': 'diamond', 'H': 'hexagon2', 'None': 'nothing', None: 'nothing', 'P': 'plus_filled', 'X': 'x_filled', '^': 'triangle_up', '_': 'hline', 'd': 'thin_diamond', 'h': 'hexagon1', 'o': 'circle', 'p': 'pentagon', 's': 'square', 'v': 'triangle_down', 'x': 'x', '|': 'vline'} ``` List of line styles {'': '_draw_nothing', ' ': '_draw_nothing', '-': '_draw_solid', '--': '_draw_dashed', '-.': '_draw_dash_dot', ':': '_draw_dotted', 'None': '_draw_nothing'} ``` List of base colors {'b': (0, 0, 1), 'c': (0, 0.75, 0.75), 'g': (0, 0.5, 0), 'k': (0, 0, 0), 'm': (0.75, 0, 0.75), 'r': (1, 0, 0), 'w': (1, 1, 1), 'y': (0.75, 0.75, 0)} list access import matplotlib as mp mp.markers.MarkerStyle.markers mp.lines.lineStyles mp.colors.BASE_COLORS Taking these long lists of available parameters, I'm going to play around with a few and see how they appear in our plot. import matplotlib as mp mp . markers .

We're now going to use that same approach but this time, the second variable that is returned (what we call ax in the cell bellow) is no longer an axes object! Instead, it is an array of axes objects. I'm also going to introduce another module, random , to generate some random values import random fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(10,10)) ax[0,1].plot(range(10), [random.random() for i in range(10)], c='tab:orange') ax[1,0].plot(range(10), [random.random() for i in range(10)], c='tab:green') ax[1,1].plot(range(10), [random.random() for i in range(10)], c='tab:red') ax[0,0].plot(range(10), [random.random() for i in range(10)], c='tab:blue') quick note: In the above cell we use something called list comprehension to quickly populate a list of objects (in this case those objects are floats). We won't dive too deeply into that now, but you can think of list comprehension as a more concise way of writing a for() loop. In future cases where list comprehension appears in this notebook I will include code snipets of the corresponding for loop. import random # this list comprehension print([random.random() for i in range(10)]) # produces the same output as this for loop ls = [] for i in range(10): ls.append(random.random()) print(ls) import random random . seed ( 42 ) # this list comprehension print ([ random . random () for i in range ( 10 )]) random . seed ( 42 ) # produces the same output as this for loop ls = [] for i in range ( 10 ): ls . append ( random . random ()) print ( ls ) [0.6394267984578837, 0.025010755222666936, 0.27502931836911926, 0.22321073814882275, 0.7364712141640124, 0.6766994874229113, 0.8921795677048454, 0.08693883262941615, 0.4219218196852704, 0.029797219438070344] [0.6394267984578837, 0.025010755222666936, 0.27502931836911926, 0.22321073814882275, 0.7364712141640124, 0.6766994874229113, 0.8921795677048454, 0.08693883262941615, 0.4219218196852704, 0.029797219438070344] The second thing we'll need to talk about is the grid of the ax object fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 2 , 2 ) we can investigate its shape: ax . shape (2, 2) as well as the contents contained within: ax array([[<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x7fcd316f9210>, <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x7fcd316490d0>], [<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x7fcd315fb710>, <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x7fcd315b0d50>]], dtype=object) This is exactly like accessing a matrix: matrix[row,column] = element we have the pandas equivalent: df.iloc[0,1] = element Putting this all together we can create the following: import random random . seed ( 42 ) fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 2 , 2 , figsize = ( 10 , 10 )) ax [ 0 , 0 ] . plot ( range ( 10 ), [ random . random () for i in range ( 10 )], c = 'tab:blue' ) ax [ 0 , 1 ] . plot ( range ( 10 ), [ random . random () for i in range ( 10 )], c = 'tab:orange' ) ax [ 1 , 0 ] . plot ( range ( 10 ), [ random . random () for i in range ( 10 )], c = 'tab:green' ) ax [ 1 , 1 ] . plot ( range ( 10 ), [ random . random () for i in range ( 10 )], c = 'tab:red' ) [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x22a7daee280>] \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 3: Subplots \u00b6 Create a 2x1 figure where the first axes is a plot of the fibonacci sequence up to the 10th sequence value and the second axes is a plot of 10 random integers with values between 10 and 20 (exclusive). Use different markers, colors, and lines for each plot. Since the focus of this tutorial is on visualization, I'll go ahead and provide my own code for generating random integers between 10 and 20 (exclusive).

While the objectives of the exercizes may be to make certain visualizations, throughout our experience we'll be using pandas tricks to create the data splices we need, so in the following is a mix of new plotting stuff, with pandas data selection/splicing stuff. We're also going to import a new module called seaborn . It is another plotting library based off matplotlib . We're going to use it to pull some stylistic features. import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns from sklearn.datasets import load_boston import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns from ipywidgets import interact The following few cells should look familiar from last tutorial session, we're going to use some essential pandas methods to get a general sense of what our dataset looks like There are many ways to construct a dataframe, as an exercise, you might think of otherways to perform that task here. df = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wesleybeckner/ds_for_engineers/main/data/wine_quality/winequalityN.csv\") df.describe() # In your subsequent time with pandas you'll discover that there are a host of # ways to populate a dataframe. In the following, I can create a dataframe # simply by using read_csv because the data is formated in a way that # pandas can easily intuit. df = pd . read_csv ( \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wesleybeckner/\" \\ \"technology_explorers/main/assets/imdb_movies.csv\" ) # we check the shape of our data to see if its as we expect df . shape (85855, 22) # we check the column names df . columns Index(['imdb_title_id', 'title', 'original_title', 'year', 'date_published', 'genre', 'duration', 'country', 'language', 'director', 'writer', 'production_company', 'actors', 'description', 'avg_vote', 'votes', 'budget', 'usa_gross_income', 'worlwide_gross_income', 'metascore', 'reviews_from_users', 'reviews_from_critics'], dtype='object') Lets start by looking at basic description of our data.

I tend to think of scatter, box, and histogram plots for numerical data and bar or sunburst charts for categorical data. 6.2.1 Scatter Plots \u00b6 The way to generate a plot in the fewest keystrokes is to simply call the plot() method within the dataframe object df.plot() # the simplest plot we can make is the following so let's start here. # We can generate a figure simply by using the plot() method of our dataframe # object. df . plot () <AxesSubplot:> This gives us a raw view of the data, but here I'd like to introduce some standard plotting steps: recall the fig , ax format we used previously. fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize = (10, 5)) df.plot(ax=ax) fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 5 )) df . plot ( ax = ax ) <AxesSubplot:> To make this into a scatter plot, we set the linestyle (or ls) to an empty string, and select a marker type. fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize = (10, 5)) df.plot(ax=ax, linestyle='', marker='.') fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 5 )) df . plot ( ax = ax , ls = '' , marker = '.' , ms = 2 ) <AxesSubplot:> To plot X and Y that are specific columns of our dataframe we specify them in the call to df.plot() fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 5 )) df . plot ( 'avg_vote' , 'metascore' , ax = ax , ls = '' , marker = '.' , ms = 2 ) <AxesSubplot:xlabel='avg_vote'> \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 4: Scatter Plots with Pandas \u00b6 Make a plot of duration vs metascore # Cell for Exercise 4 fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 5 )) # plot the data <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7fcd18498ad0> 6.2.2 Bar Plots \u00b6 One of the more common methods of depicting aggregate data is bar plots. We almost always see these kinds of plots used to display and compare between averages, but sometimes between singular data values as well. fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(10,7.5)) df.groupby('country').filter(lambda x: x.shape[0] > 100).\\ groupby('country')['duration'].mean().sort_values()\\ [-20:].plot(kind='barh', ax=ax) fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 7.5 )) df . groupby ( 'country' ) . filter ( lambda x : x . shape [ 0 ] > 100 ) . \\ groupby ( 'country' )[ 'duration' ] . mean () . sort_values ( na_position = 'first' ) \\ [ - 20 :] . plot ( kind = 'barh' , ax = ax ) <AxesSubplot:ylabel='country'> 6.3 \ud83c\udf52 Enrichment: Other Plot Types \u00b6 6.3.1 Box Plots \u00b6 Maybe we thought it was usefull to see the feature data in the scatter plots ( we can visually scan for correlations between feature sets, check outliers, etc.) but perhaps more instructive, is a boxplot. A box plot or boxplot is a statistical method for graphically depicting aggregate data through their quartiles. It will be useful to inspect the boxplot API to see the default behavior for representing the quartiles and outliers. fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize = (10, 5)) df.plot(kind='box', ax=ax) fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 7.5 )) df . groupby ( 'country' ) . filter (( lambda x : ( x . shape [ 0 ] > 100 ) & # filter by number of datapoints ( x [ 'duration' ] . mean () < 100 )) # filter by average movie time ) . boxplot ( by = 'country' , column = 'duration' , rot = 90 , ax = ax ) /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/numpy/core/_asarray.py:83: VisibleDeprecationWarning: Creating an ndarray from ragged nested sequences (which is a list-or-tuple of lists-or-tuples-or ndarrays with different lengths or shapes) is deprecated. If you meant to do this, you must specify 'dtype=object' when creating the ndarray return array(a, dtype, copy=False, order=order) <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7fcd04c5d9d0> 6.3.2 Histograms \u00b6 What are some other kinds of plots we can make? A good one to be aware of is the histogram. plt.title('Demo Hist') plt.xlabel('Duration') plt.ylabel('Frequency') plt.hist(df['duration']) plt . title ( 'Demo Hist' ) plt . xlabel ( 'Duration' ) plt . ylabel ( 'Frequency' ) plt . hist ( df [ 'duration' ]) (array([7.2368e+04, 1.3197e+04, 2.2800e+02, 4.0000e+01, 1.1000e+01, 4.0000e+00, 4.0000e+00, 1.0000e+00, 1.0000e+00, 1.0000e+00]), array([ 41. , 117.7, 194.4, 271.1, 347.8, 424.5, 501.2, 577.9, 654.6, 731.3, 808. ]), <a list of 10 Patch objects>) df [ 'duration' ] . plot ( kind = 'hist' ) <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7fcd0471d210> 6.3.3 Kernel Density Estimates \u00b6 Another useful plot type for data analysis is the kernel density estimate. You can think of this plot as exactly like a histogram, except instead of creating bins in which to accrue datapoints, you deposit a gaussian distribution around every datapoint in your dataset. By this mechanism, you avoid creating bias in your data summary as you otherwise would be when predifining bin sizes and locations in a histogram. fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 5 )) df [ 'duration' ] . plot ( kind = 'kde' , ax = ax ) <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7fcd046ac7d0> \ud83c\udf52\ud83c\udf52 6.3.3.1 Double Enrichment: Skew and Tailedness \u00b6 While we're on the topic of KDEs/histograms and other statistical plots, this is a convenient time to talk about skew and tailedness or, otherwise known as kurtosis df.skew() indicates the skewdness of the data df.kurtosis() indicates the tailedness of the data # from scipy.stats import skewnorm from ipywidgets import FloatSlider slider = FloatSlider ( value = 0.5 , min = 0.5 , max = 5 , step = 0.5 , description = 'Shape:' , disabled = False , continuous_update = False , orientation = 'horizontal' , readout = True , readout_format = '.1f' ) import numpy as np def inspect_kurt_skew ( a = slider ): # theres another hyperparameter, lambda for the center # of weibull. the shape parameter is sometimes called # a, or k fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 5 , 5 )) s = np . random . weibull ( a , 1000 ) statdf = pd . DataFrame ( s ) statdf [ 0 ] . plot ( kind = 'kde' , ax = ax ) print ( \"skew: {:.2f} \" . format ( statdf [ 0 ] . skew ())) print ( \"kurtosis: {:.2f} \" . format ( statdf [ 0 ] . kurt ())) interact ( inspect_kurt_skew ) interactive(children=(FloatSlider(value=0.5, continuous_update=False, description='Shape:', max=5.0, min=0.5, \u2026 <function __main__.inspect_kurt_skew> 6.3.4 Correlation Plots \u00b6 Often, we'll want to quantify the strength of a relationship between input variables. We can do this by calculating correlations. We won't go into great detail here about how Pearson's correlation is calculated, but the StatQuest videos on this subject are here for reference (and are really good... if you can stomach Starmer's humor) StatQuest: Correlation StatQuest: Covariance The main takeaway is that pearson's correlation ranges from -1 to 1 and indicates how positively or negatively correlated the variables in question are. For our purposes, this can give insight into what variables will be important in our machine learning model. We can get the pearson's correlation between all the input features using the dataframe.corr() method. Fig: pearson's correlation value and corresponding scatter plot of feature-x and feature-y df . corr () .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } duration avg_vote votes metascore reviews_from_users reviews_from_critics duration 1.000000 0.242432 0.125618 0.210531 0.130836 0.135465 avg_vote 0.242432 1.000000 0.166972 0.691338 0.138185 0.200526 votes 0.125618 0.166972 1.000000 0.194730 0.766237 0.671635 metascore 0.210531 0.691338 0.194730 1.000000 0.126131 0.236107 reviews_from_users 0.130836 0.138185 0.766237 0.126131 1.000000 0.671634 reviews_from_critics 0.135465 0.200526 0.671635 0.236107 0.671634 1.000000 So we have this raw table of pearsons correlations between each of our input features, how do we and how should we turn this into a plot? Typically we'd use a heat map on a feature vs feature grid to view this kind of data. In the following I'm going to use some numpy methods you may not have seen before. Links to the documentation for these methods are at the end of the notebook. import numpy as np fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize = (10,10)) # create a mask to white-out the upper triangle mask = np.triu(np.ones_like(df.corr(), dtype=bool)) # we'll want a divergent colormap for this so our eye # is not attracted to the values close to 0 cmap = sns.diverging_palette(230, 20, as_cmap=True) sns.heatmap(df.corr(), mask=mask, cmap=cmap, ax=ax) sns . heatmap ( df . corr ()) <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7fcd023a6a10> import numpy as np fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 10 )) # create a mask to white-out the upper triangle mask = np . triu ( np . ones_like ( df . corr (), dtype = bool )) # we'll want a divergent colormap for this so our eye # is not attracted to the values close to 0 cmap = sns . diverging_palette ( 230 , 20 , as_cmap = True ) sns . heatmap ( df . corr (), mask = mask , cmap = cmap , ax = ax ) <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7fcd0239fc90> What do we notice? looks like reviews and votes are all pretty correlated. Surprising? 6.4 Visualization with IpyWidgets \u00b6 6.4.1 Interact \u00b6 Here we're going to introduce a very basic use case of IPython's widgets using interact . The interact method ( ipywidgets.interact ) automatically creates user interface (UI) controls for exploring code and data interactively. It is the easiest way to get started using IPython\u2019s widgets. def my_plot ( col = df . select_dtypes ( 'number' ) . columns ): fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 5 )) df . groupby ( 'country' ) . filter ( lambda x : x . shape [ 0 ] > 100 ) . \\ groupby ( 'country' )[ col ] . mean () . sort_values ( na_position = 'first' ) \\ [ - 20 :] . plot ( kind = 'barh' , ax = ax ) After defining our function that returns our plot, and defining input parameters for the fields we would like to interact with, we call our function with interact interact(my_plot) interact ( my_plot ) interactive(children=(Dropdown(description='col', options=('duration', 'avg_vote', 'votes', 'metascore', 'revi\u2026 <function __main__.my_plot(col=Index(['duration', 'avg_vote', 'votes', 'metascore', 'reviews_from_users', 'reviews_from_critics'], dtype='object'))> Let's break this down. Normally, I would just set my y-variable to a value, so that when I call my function, my figure is generated with the corresponding data field: def my_plot ( col = 'duration' ): fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 5 )) df . groupby ( 'country' ) . filter ( lambda x : x . shape [ 0 ] > 100 ) . \\ groupby ( 'country' )[ col ] . mean () . sort_values ( na_position = 'first' ) \\ [ - 20 :] . plot ( kind = 'barh' , ax = ax ) my_plot () Instead, we want to give interact() a list of values for the user to select from, this is the difference between a regular function, and one we might feed into interact. y = ['duration', 'avg_vote', 'votes', 'metascore', 'reviews_from_users', 'reviews_from_critics'] list ( df . select_dtypes ( 'number' ) . columns ) ['duration', 'avg_vote', 'votes', 'metascore', 'reviews_from_users', 'reviews_from_critics'] \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 5: IpyWidgets and Figures in Functions \u00b6 In the previous section we created a single dropdown menu to select our y variable for our plot. Here, we would like to do the same thing, but this time for directors rather than country. Filter your dataframe for only directors that have 5 or more datapoints and only return the top 10 highest average values (there should be 10 directors in the final plot). When you build the interactive plot, grouby director this time instead of country. # Code block for Exercise 5 def my_plot ( col = df . select_dtypes ( 'number' ) . columns ): fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 5 )) df . groupby ( 'director' ) . filter ( lambda x : x . shape [ 0 ] > 5 ) . \\ groupby ( 'director' )[ col ] . mean () . sort_values ( na_position = 'first' ) \\ [ - 10 :] . plot ( kind = 'barh' , ax = ax ) interact ( my_plot ) interactive(children=(Dropdown(description='col', options=('duration', 'avg_vote', 'votes', 'metascore', 'revi\u2026 <function __main__.my_plot(col=Index(['duration', 'avg_vote', 'votes', 'metascore', 'reviews_from_users', 'reviews_from_critics'], dtype='object'))> 6.5 \ud83c\udf52 Enrichment: Other Plot Types (Continued) \u00b6 6.5.1 Bar Plots (Advanced) \u00b6 Similar to how we created bar plots with pandas, we can use matplotlib to make barplots pokemon = ['Charmander', 'Pikachu', 'Squirtle', 'Bulbasaur'] hp = [10, 12, 8, 16] plt.bar(pokemon, hp, color='tab:blue') plt.title('Pokemon HP') plt.xlabel('Pokemon') plt.ylabel('HP') pokemon = [ 'Charmander' , 'Pikachu' , 'Squirtle' , 'Bulbasaur' ] hp = [ 10 , 12 , 8 , 16 ] plt . bar ( pokemon , hp , color = 'tab:blue' ) plt . title ( 'Pokemon HP' ) plt . xlabel ( 'Pokemon' ) plt . ylabel ( 'HP' ) Text(0, 0.5, 'HP') Doing the same but with horizontally oriented bars pokemon = ['Charmander', 'Pikachu', 'Squirtle', 'Bulbasaur'] hp = [10, 12, 8, 16] plt.barh(pokemon, hp, color='tab:blue') plt.title('Pokemon HP') plt.ylabel('Pokemon') plt.xlabel('HP') pokemon = [ 'Charmander' , 'Pikachu' , 'Squirtle' , 'Bulbasaur' ] hp = [ 10 , 12 , 8 , 16 ] plt . barh ( pokemon , hp , color = 'tab:blue' ) plt . title ( 'Pokemon HP' ) plt . ylabel ( 'Pokemon' ) plt . xlabel ( 'HP' ) Text(0.5, 0, 'HP') We can also add error bars pokemon = ['Charmander', 'Pikachu', 'Squirtle', 'Bulbasaur'] hp = [10, 12, 8, 16] variance = [i * random.random()*.25 for i in hp] plt.barh(pokemon, hp, xerr=variance, color='tab:blue') plt.title('Pokemon HP') plt.ylabel('Pokemon') plt.xlabel('HP') for loop version of list comprehension hp = [10, 12, 8, 16] variance = [] for i in hp: variance.append(i * random.random()*.25) print(variance) pokemon = [ 'Charmander' , 'Pikachu' , 'Squirtle' , 'Bulbasaur' ] hp = [ 10 , 12 , 8 , 16 ] variance = [ i * random . random () * .25 for i in hp ] plt . barh ( pokemon , hp , xerr = variance , color = 'tab:blue' ) plt . title ( 'Pokemon HP' ) plt . ylabel ( 'Pokemon' ) plt . xlabel ( 'HP' ) Text(0.5, 0, 'HP') 6.5.2 3D Plots \u00b6 You can also create 3D plots in matplotlib using ax.scatter3D ax = plt.axes(projection='3d') ax.scatter3D(range(10),[i*random.random()*.25 for i in range(10)]) for loop version of list comprehension: ls = [] for i in range(10): ls.append(i*random.random()*.25) print(ls) ax = plt . axes ( projection = '3d' ) ax . scatter3D ( range ( 10 ),[ i * random . random () * .25 for i in range ( 10 )]) <mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d.Path3DCollection at 0x7fdf86d241d0> 6.5.3 Visualization with Plotly \u00b6 Another great plotting library, that is gaining in popularity (especially in enterprise settings) is plotly. As an added exercise, if you have additional time, explore some of the plotly examples then recreate the breakout room assignment using plotly instead of matplotlib. 6.5.3.1 Scatter Plot with Size and

I'm going to create a list of x and y values and plot them with pyplot x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] y = [1,1,2,3,5,8,13] plt.plot(x,y) x = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] y = [ 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 ] plt . plot ( x , y ) [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x22a7cd340d0>]","title":"6.1.1 The Basics"},{"location":"S6_Matplotlib/#question-1","text":"What do we think about the out-of-the-box formatting of pyplot ? What are some things we can do to make it better? Could we make it bigger? Perhaps different dimensions? Does anyone recognize that default line color? Before we make any changes, let's become acquianted with the more appropriate way to work in matplotlib.pyplot . In this formality, we explicitly create our figure and axes objects. You can think of the figure as a canvas, where you specify dimensions and possibly unifying attributes of its contents, like, background color, border, etc. You use the canvas, the figure , to containerize your other objects, primarily your axes , and to save its contents with savefig . You can think of an axes as the actual graphs or plots themselves. And when we declare these objects, we have access to all the methods of matplotlib.pyplot (e.g. .plot , .scatter , .hist etc.) You can place many of these axes into the figure container in a variety of ways. The last component of a pyplot figure are the axis , the graphical axis we typically think of. plt.subplots returns a figure and axes object(s) together: ### We can create the figure (fig) and axes (ax) in a single line fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(8,8)) and we'll go ahead and adjust the figure size with the parameter figsize and set it equal to a tuple containing the x and y dimensions of the figure in inches. # We can create the figure (fig) and axes (ax) in a single line fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 5 )) To recap, by convention we typically separate our plots into three components: a Figure, its Axes, and their Axis: Figure : It is a whole figure which may contain one or more than one axes (plots). You can think of a figure as a canvas which contains plots. Axes : It is what we generally think of as a plot. A figure can contain many axes . It contains two or three (in the case of 3D) axis objects. Each axes has a title, an x-label and a y-label. Axis : They are the traditional axis we think of in a graph and take care of generating the graph limits. Example: fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(8,8)) is creating the figure ( fig ) and axes ( ax ) explicitly, and depending on whether we create 2D or 3D plots, the axes will contain 2-3 axis .","title":"\ud83d\ude4b Question 1"},{"location":"S6_Matplotlib/#exercise-1-adjust-figure-size","text":"create a figure and axes using plt.subplots() . adjust the figure size to be 6 inches (width) by 3 inches (height).

Today, we will jump into the Numpy package. numpy : Numerical Python \u00b6 Numpy is short for \"Numerical Python\", and contains tools for efficient manipulation of arrays of data. If you have used other computational tools like IDL or MatLab, Numpy should feel very familiar. Import Libraries \u00b6 # for numpy section import numpy as np np . random . seed ( 42 ) 7.1 NumPy Arrays \u00b6 7.1.1 Creating NumPy Arrays \u00b6 When we worked with lists, we saw that we could fill them with all sorts of datatypes. NumPy arrays are necessarily of one datatype: # these will all be ints np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 5 , 4 ]) array([1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4]) # these will all be floats np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3.14 , 6 , 5 , 4 ]) array([1. , 2. , 3.14, 6. , 5. , 4. ]) We can check the data types in the standard way: arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 5 , 4 ]) for i in arr : print ( type ( i )) <class 'numpy.int64'> <class 'numpy.int64'> <class 'numpy.int64'> <class 'numpy.int64'> <class 'numpy.int64'> <class 'numpy.int64'> We see that all types are upcast to the most complext object in the array. For instance, because 3.14 is a float, all the other numbers in the array will be a float: for i in np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3.14 , 6 , 5 , 4 ]): print ( type ( i )) <class 'numpy.float64'> <class 'numpy.float64'> <class 'numpy.float64'> <class 'numpy.float64'> <class 'numpy.float64'> <class 'numpy.float64'> We can also specify the datatypes in the array: np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3.14 , 6 , 5 , 4 ], dtype = 'float32' ) array([1. , 2. , 3.14, 6. , 5. , 4. ], dtype=float32) \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 1: Specify datatype \u00b6 Create an array of 5 numbers whose datatypes are 16 bit integers. Make one of the numbers not a whole number. What happens to the number when it is stored in the 16 bit integer array? # Cell for Exercise 1 7.1.2 Creating Arrays from NumPy Methods \u00b6 # create an array of 10 zeros # how can we specify the datatype? np . zeros ( 10 ) array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]) # create an array of 10 1's np . ones ( 10 ) array([1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.]) # fill an array of the following dimensions # with value 42 np . full (( 2 , 3 ), 42 ) array([[42, 42, 42], [42, 42, 42]]) # arange from start (inc) to stop (exc) # integers with step size np . arange ( 1 , 10 , 2 ) array([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) # create an array of numbers that divides # the space between start and stop (inc, inc) # with X equally spaced intervals np . linspace ( 0 , 10 , 5 ) array([ 0. , 2.5, 5. , 7.5, 10. ]) # create an array of values drawn from a # uniform distribution np . random . random ( 5 ) array([0.37454012, 0.95071431, 0.73199394, 0.59865848, 0.15601864]) # create an array of values from a normal distribution np . random . normal ( loc = 0 , scale = 1 , size = ( 5 , 5 )) array([[ 0.61764085, 1.2170708 , 0.22628827, 0.84740143, 0.17483301], [-1.21685489, 1.04934739, 1.32510566, 0.73450106, -0.95449726], [-0.75117942, -1.13042805, 0.76997736, 1.26838952, 0.42448624], [ 0.94053558, -0.86764109, 0.14586185, -1.36987106, -0.77178075], [ 0.87867355, -0.23959451, 1.20938197, 0.53796 , 2.73442216]]) # create an array of random integers between 5 and 10 with shape 2x2 np . random . randint ( 5 , 11 , ( 2 , 2 )) array([[5, 9], [8, 9]]) \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 2: Creating Arrays \u00b6 a. Create a 5x5 array of ones with datatype int16 # Cell for Exercise 2a b. Create an array of 10 numbers drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 # Cell for Exercise 2b c. Create an array of 10 numbers drawn from a normal distribution centered at 80 with a standard deviation of 5 # Cell for Exercise 2c d. Create an array of 10 intergers drawn from a uniform distribution between 5 and 10 inclusive # Cell for Exercise 2d 7.2 NumPy Array Attributes \u00b6 Common array attributes are shape , size , nbytes , and itemsize my_arr = np . random . randint ( low = 5 , high = 10 , size = ( 5 , 5 )) print ( my_arr ) [[7 8 7 5 5] [8 8 9 9 7] [8 5 9 9 5] [9 7 8 5 8] [9 9 5 7 6]] my_arr . shape (5, 5) my_arr . dtype dtype('int64') my_arr . size 25 my_arr . nbytes 200 my_arr . itemsize 8 \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 3: Conditional Check on Array Attributes \u00b6 write a conditional that checks that the total number of bytes of the array object my_arr divided by the size of each item (in bytes) is equal to the number of items in the array ( hint: we covered the attributes above ) # Cell for exercise 3 True 7.3 NumPy Array Slicing, Copying, Setting \u00b6 Array slicing operates much the same way as with python lists my_arr array([[7, 8, 7, 5, 5], [8, 8, 9, 9, 7], [8, 5, 9, 9, 5], [9, 7, 8, 5, 8], [9, 9, 5, 7, 6]]) # grab the first row my_arr [ 0 ] array([7, 8, 7, 5, 5]) # grab the first element of the first row # instead of this print ( my_arr [ 0 ][ 0 ]) # we do this print ( my_arr [ 0 , 0 ]) 9 9 We can time these... %% timeit my_arr [ 0 ][ 0 ] The slowest run took 38.40 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached. 1000000 loops, best of 5: 381 ns per loop %% timeit my_arr [ 0 , 0 ] The slowest run took 60.67 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached. 10000000 loops, best of 5: 170 ns per loop We can use the same slicing notation as with lists my_arr[start:stop:step] for n-dimensional arrays my_arr[1-start:1-stop:1-step, 2-start:2-stop:2-step, ... n-start:n-stop:n-step] # with arrays, we simply separate each dimension with a comma my_arr [: 2 , : 2 ] array([[7, 8], [8, 8]]) Slices are views not copies. This means we can set slices of arrays to new values, and the original object will change: my_arr [: 2 , : 2 ] = 0 my_arr array([[0, 0, 7, 5, 5], [0, 0, 9, 9, 7], [8, 5, 9, 9, 5], [9, 7, 8, 5, 8], [9, 9, 5, 7, 6]]) my_arr [ - 2 :, - 2 :] = 1 my_arr array([[0, 0, 7, 5, 5], [0, 0, 9, 9, 7], [8, 5, 9, 9, 5], [9, 7, 8, 1, 1], [9, 9, 5, 1, 1]]) Step through an array slice # remember that we can use steps in slicing my_arr [:, :: 2 ] # the last number after :: is the step size array([[0, 7, 5], [0, 9, 7], [8, 9, 5], [9, 8, 1], [9, 5, 1]]) We can use negative step sizes the way we do with lists. A negative step size reverses the order of start and stop, so it is a convenient way to reverse the order of one or more dimensions of an array # reverse the rows my_arr [:: - 1 ] array([[9, 9, 5, 1, 1], [9, 7, 8, 1, 1], [8, 5, 9, 9, 5], [0, 0, 9, 9, 7], [0, 0, 7, 5, 5]]) # reverse the columns my_arr [:, :: - 1 ] array([[5, 5, 7, 0, 0], [7, 9, 9, 0, 0], [5, 9, 9, 5, 8], [1, 1, 8, 7, 9], [1, 1, 5, 9, 9]]) Sometimes we want to create a copy of an array, despite the default slicing behavior. We can do this with the .copy() method new_arr = my_arr . copy () new_arr [:,:] = 0 print ( my_arr ) [[0 0 7 5 5] [0 0 9 9 7] [8 5 9 9 5] [9 7 8 1 1] [9 9 5 1 1]] \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 4: Array Setting and Slicing \u00b6 set all the even columns of my_arr to 0 and all the odd columns to 1 (interpret the first column to be 1 and the last to be 5, i.e. don't index at 0 when thinking of each column as even/odd!) Example Output: array([[0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]]) # Cell for Exercise 4 array([[0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]]) 7.4 NumPy Array Reshaping, Concatenation, and Splitting \u00b6 reshaping is going to be a common task for us: arr = np . arange ( 9 ) arr array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]) # reshape into a 3x3 array arr . reshape ( 3 , 3 ) # rows then columns array([[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]) The reshaped dimensions have to be evenly divisible into the total number of elements: -1 will infer the proper dimension based on the other dimensions provided and the total number of elements # arr.reshape(4,2) # throws and error arr = np . arange ( 12 ) arr . reshape ( 4 , 3 ) array([[ 0, 1, 2], [ 3, 4, 5], [ 6, 7, 8], [ 9, 10, 11]]) A common manipulation in numpy is to convert a 1 dimensional array into a 2 dimensional array. You will see this frequently when working with test/train datasets in machine learning. arr = np . arange ( 9 ) # reshape into 2 dimensions arr . reshape ( - 1 , 1 ) array([[0], [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]]) # back to one dimension arr . reshape ( 9 ) array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]) We can also concatenate arrays arr1 = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) arr2 = np . array ([ 4 , 5 , 6 ]) print ( arr1 , arr2 ) [1 2 3] [4 5 6] # now a single array np . concatenate (( arr1 , arr2 )) array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) vstack or vertical stack will place the two arrays on top of eachother: np . vstack (( arr1 , arr2 )) array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]) hstack will place them side by side np . hstack (( arr1 , arr2 )) array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) arr1 = np . array ([[ 1 , 2 , 3 ],[ 7 , 8 , 9 ]]) arr2 = np . array ([ 4 , 5 , 6 ]) print ( arr1 ) print ( arr2 ) print ( arr1 . shape ) [[1 2 3] [7 8 9]] [4 5 6] (2, 3) np . vstack (( arr1 , arr2 )) array([[1, 2, 3], [7, 8, 9], [4, 5, 6]]) Lastly, we can also split arrays. We give the indices where the split should be performed arr = np . random . randint ( 5 , 11 , ( 10 , 10 )) arr array([[ 5, 6, 10, 6, 7, 10, 6, 10, 6, 7], [ 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 5, 7, 10, 9, 6], [ 6, 7, 6, 5, 9, 8, 6, 5, 8, 9], [ 8, 5, 10, 10, 8, 7, 8, 6, 6, 10], [ 7, 5, 6, 10, 9, 10, 6, 6, 10, 5], [ 8, 6, 10, 10, 7, 8, 9, 5, 9, 8], [ 8, 8, 9, 8, 10, 9, 8, 10, 7, 8], [ 9, 6, 8, 6, 10, 7, 5, 7, 8, 6], [ 6, 9, 6, 9, 10, 5, 8, 9, 5, 6], [ 6, 5, 6, 10, 10, 5, 9, 9, 5, 9]]) a , b = np . split ( arr , [ 5 ]) print ( a ) print ( b ) [[ 8 9 7 7 10 8 6 6 9 10] [ 5 9 10 8 8 8 8 8 10 10] [ 7 6 8 5 10 5 5 5 7 10] [ 5 8 9 5 7 10 7 5 10 9] [ 5 7 6 8 7 10 5 8 5 10]] [[ 5 6 8 8 10 6 7 5 9 5] [ 5 7 5 6 6 8 10 9 5 5] [ 7 10 6 9 8 6 10 8 7 7] [ 5 10 9 8 6 10 10 7 5 5] [ 8 7 10 9 7 8 8 7 8 7]] np . vsplit ( arr , [ 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 ]) [array([[ 5, 6, 10, 6, 7, 10, 6, 10, 6, 7], [ 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 5, 7, 10, 9, 6]]), array([[ 6, 7, 6, 5, 9, 8, 6, 5, 8, 9], [ 8, 5, 10, 10, 8, 7, 8, 6, 6, 10]]), array([[ 7, 5, 6, 10, 9, 10, 6, 6, 10, 5], [ 8, 6, 10, 10, 7, 8, 9, 5, 9, 8]]), array([[ 8, 8, 9, 8, 10, 9, 8, 10, 7, 8], [ 9, 6, 8, 6, 10, 7, 5, 7, 8, 6]]), array([[ 6, 9, 6, 9, 10, 5, 8, 9, 5, 6], [ 6, 5, 6, 10, 10, 5, 9, 9, 5, 9]])] np . hsplit ( arr , [ 5 ]) [array([[ 5, 6, 10, 6, 7], [ 6, 6, 6, 5, 5], [ 6, 7, 6, 5, 9], [ 8, 5, 10, 10, 8], [ 7, 5, 6, 10, 9], [ 8, 6, 10, 10, 7], [ 8, 8, 9, 8, 10], [ 9, 6, 8, 6, 10], [ 6, 9, 6, 9, 10], [ 6, 5, 6, 10, 10]]), array([[10, 6, 10, 6, 7], [ 5, 7, 10, 9, 6], [ 8, 6, 5, 8, 9], [ 7, 8, 6, 6, 10], [10, 6, 6, 10, 5], [ 8, 9, 5, 9, 8], [ 9, 8, 10, 7, 8], [ 7, 5, 7, 8, 6], [ 5, 8, 9, 5, 6], [ 5, 9, 9, 5, 9]])] \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 5: Reshaping and Concatenating \u00b6 We'll practice a few of these methods we've learned. make arr2 match the shape of arr1 using reshape stack arr1 on top of arr2 using vstack and call this new array arr replace all the even columns of arr with zeros return the sum of arr using arr.sum() starting code: np.random.seed(42) arr1 = np.random.randint(5, 11, (5,10)) arr2 = np.random.randint(5, 11, (10,5)) expected output: 374 np . random . seed ( 42 ) arr1 = np . random . randint ( 5 , 11 , ( 5 , 10 )) arr2 = np . random . randint ( 5 , 11 , ( 10 , 5 )) print ( arr1 , end = ' \\n\\n ' ) print ( arr2 ) [[ 8 9 7 9 9 6 7 7 7 9] [ 8 7 10 9 6 8 10 10 6 8] [ 9 5 8 6 10 9 8 5 5 7] [ 7 6 8 8 10 10 10 7 8 8] [ 5 7 9 7 9 5 6 8 5 8]] [[10 6 6 5 6] [ 9 6 8 8 8] [ 8 9 7 10 5] [ 8 6 8 6 10] [10 10 6 8 10] [ 9 6 6 8 6] [ 6 10 8 10 10] [ 8 5 10 9 9] [ 6 9 6 5 8] [ 8 8 9 5 9]] # Cell for Exercise 5 374 7.5 Additional Exercises \u00b6 \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 6: boolean Array \u00b6 Create a 3x3 array of all True's (booleans) # Cell for Exercise 6 \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 7: Index on Conditional \u00b6 extract all numbers divisible by 3 arr = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) # Cell for Exercise 7 arr = np . array ([ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ]) 7.5.3 np.where \u00b6 There is a nifty tool, np.where() .

This is particularly well suited for tasks that would otherwise require a lot of memory to hold intermediary solutions (when they are combined with a strategy called memoization which we will shy away from here). The Fibonnaci sequence is a good place for such a problem. So is a factorial calculation.

It is the answer to the simplest subset of the problem. When we build a recursive tree, it is useful to think of the smallest problem, and work upwards, providing this leaf solution to nodes further up on the recursive tree. Like so: # 1! = 1 # 2! = 2 * 1! # 3! = 3 * 2! # N! = N * (N-1)! ... like ... like so This problem is intended to be a fun way to wrap our heads around functions... don't stress.

See here below 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 def factorial ( x ): \"\"\"This is a recursive function to find the factorial of an integer\"\"\" if x == 1 : return 1 else : # one trick to note that is common with recursive functions # is that the incrementation in the key variable is done # in the call to the function itself (vs a for loop) return ( x * factorial ( x - 1 )) n = 3 factorial ( n ) 6 In the above, we have on lines 5 and 6, what we call the baseline solution. It is the answer to the simplest subset of the problem. When we build a recursive tree, it is useful to think of the smallest problem, and work upwards, providing this leaf solution to nodes further up on the recursive tree. Like so: # 1! = 1 # 2! = 2 * 1! # 3! = 3 * 2! # N! = N * (N-1)! ... like ... like so This problem is intended to be a fun way to wrap our heads around functions... don't stress.

In order to complete this notebook you will have to have covered sessions 1-3 where we discuss python, conditionals/flow, and functions. 1.1 Defining and Visualizing the Board \u00b6 1.1 Q1 \u00b6 First we need to define our board object (object in the loose sense for now!). This will hold the memory of where our current player pieces are. Say we eventually want to place in every board position a string variable, 'X' or 'O' . How would we represent the board? Also, how do we represent it in the least complex space possible, i.e. a list? Example output: [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '] # cell for Q1 # create a variable called \"board\" and set it equal to a list of 9 strings # filled with a single white space [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '] 1.1 Q2 \u00b6 We would like to be able to visualize where our players have executed onto the board. How can we use what we've learned about print functions to visualize an empty board? hint: use | , \\n , .format() , and unpack our board elements using an asteric ( *board ) with the print function. Example output: | | | | | | | | | | | | # Cell for Q2 # call the print() function on your board; if you can get your output to look # like the example in a single print() call, great! if not, don't worry! solve # this however you feel comfortable. Just make sure the output looks like the # example | | | | | | | | | | | | 1.1 Q3 \u00b6 After you've created your print script that takes the board as an input, test it out by filling your board with some X's and O's Example output: |X| | | | |O| | | | | | # Cell for Q3 # now copy and paste your code from above, but before you run your script, fill # in an 'X' in the first (0-index) position of your board list and an 'O' in the # 4th (3-index) position |X| | | | |O| | | | | | 1.1 Q4 \u00b6 Now, if that looks good, wrap the print function in a function called visualize_board that takes the variable board as a parameter. Example: visualize_board(board) |X| | | | |O| | | | | | # Cell for Q4 # now write a function called \"visualize_board\" that takes in your board object # as an input and prints out the board the way we just prototyped above. visualize_board ( board ) |X| | | | |O| | | | | | 1.1 Q5 \u00b6 It may be more useful to organize our board into a dictionary. Recreate your board variable now using integers 1-9 as the keys and empty strings ' ' as the values. What do you now need to feed into your function visualize_board for it to output the same result? hint: think of an attribute of the dictionary you just created. # Cell for Q5 1.1 Q6 \u00b6 Lastly, write a function called init_board that takes no parameters and returns the empty board dictionary # Cell for Q6 1.2 Checking for a Winner \u00b6 1.2 Q1 \u00b6 We will need a way to check if either player has won the game. Write down all the winning patterns using our board representation where places are numbered 1-9. Store these patterns in a list of lists called win_patterns hint: You should identify 8 winning patterns # Cell for Q1 1.2 Q2 \u00b6 Next, we will need to write a function that checks if there is a winning pattern on our board (i.e. all X's or all O's are in the indicated places on the board. But let's build the conditionals and logic methodically and not just jump into writing a for loop! First, access the first element of win_patterns and set it equal to a variable called pattern Example output: [1, 2, 3] # Cell for Q2 [1, 2, 3] 1.2 Q3 \u00b6 Use the board dictionary to get the board values at the positions stored in pattern Example Output: ['X', ' ', ' '] # Cell for Q3 ['X', ' ', ' '] 1.2 Q4 \u00b6 Now check for whether they contain 3 X's or 3 O's. Fill those spaces with all 'X's or all 'O's to check that your conditional is working properly. Your output should be a boolean : True or False # Cell for Q4 True 1.2 Q5 \u00b6 Now we're ready to wrap this in a for loop. Loop through every pattern in win_patterns and evaluate with your conditional. If 'X' wins then print out 'X' Won! if 'O' wins then print out 'O' Won! Example output: 'O' Won! # Cell for Q5 'O' Won! 1.2 Q6 \u00b6 Once we've detected a winner, there's no need to continue the for-loop. Put breaks in your loop so that it exits after detecting a winner # Cell for Q6 'O' Won! 1.2 Q7 \u00b6 let's wrap this in a function. Call your function check_winning and have it take board as an input parameter. Make what were previously your print statements into returns of their respective strings. Return an empty string if there is no winner detected. # Cell for Q7 Check that your code works using a board that has either 'X' or 'O' as a winner. # Cell for Q7 \"'X' Won!\" 1.3 Input from the User \u00b6 We can get input from the user like so: move = input () 1 1.3 Q1 \u00b6 Let's ask the user for their move and create some logic to embed this into the board. First write your string that will be presented to the user, asking them to play their move. player = 'X' board = init_board () visualize_board ( board . values ()) # WRITE YOUR STRING DOWN HERE move = input ( \" {} , YOUR STRING\" . format ( player )) | | | | | | | | | | | | X, YOUR STRING1 1.3 Q2 \u00b6 Great. Now we need to check that the position is actually available to the user, if not, ask the user for a different move; otherwise update the board and ask for the next move from the next player hint: you will need to convert your input into an int to be able to use it as a key in the board dictionary ### COPY YOUR CODE FROM ABOVE ### ### END COPY ### ### WRITE YOUR CONDITIONAL BELOW # note: you will need to think of both the conditional, as well as a method # to continue asking the player to make a move if the condition is not met # what kind of loop does this make you think of? while True : if # your condition # your code else : board [ move ] = player break ### END YOUR CODE winner = check_winning ( board ) | | | | | | | | | | | | X, YOUR STRING1 1.4 Creating a Game Handler \u00b6 1.4 Q1 \u00b6 We now need some code to orchestrate game play. It will decide who's turn it is, allow players to make moves, and detect when the game is over. Fill in the blanks in the code cell below to complete the game handler: print ( \"'X' will go first!\" ) board = init_board () # initiate a while loop while True : # create a for loop that iterates between X and O and stores this in the # variable name `player` for player in ([ 'X' , 'O' ]): # visualize the board visualize_board ( board . values ()) ### PASTE YOUR CODE FROM ABOVE FOR ASKING THE PLAYER FOR THEIR MOVE ### ### END PASTE ### ### WRITE THE LOGIC TO BREAK OUT OF THE WHILE LOOP BELOW ### # check if there is a winner using check_winning # if the return from check_winning is an empty string, # then continue the while loop, otherwise break the while loop and print # the name of the winner (X or O) winner = check_winning ( board ) if # your condition # your code else : # your code # break out of outer loop if winner != '' : break 'X' will go first! | | | | | | | | | | | | X, what's your move?1 |X| | | | | | | | | | | O, what's your move?1 O, that position is already taken! What's your move?1 O, that position is already taken! What's your move?1 O, that position is already taken!

This is one flag that should notify us: \"hey, this might be a good place to switch from functions, to an object with methods!\" Let's try to organize this into a more object oriented scheme. \ud83d\ude4b Question 1 \u00b6 We'll also want to write a function that does what hint: what is our check_winning function missing? 2.1.1 Thinking in Objects \u00b6 It's helpful to think of how our code can be divided into useful segments that can then be extended, interfaced, used elsewhere, etc. It's just like we had when we were playing with our Poke ball and pokemon objects. In that case, it made sense to make two separate objects one for pokemon and one for Poke balls. \ud83d\ude4b Question 2 \u00b6 Can you think of any way that would make sense to divide our code into objects? I can think of two. 2.1.2 class TicTacToe \u00b6 the first object will be one that handles our board and all of its methods and attributes. In this class called TicTacToe we will have the attributes: * winner , initialized as an empty string, and updates at the conclusion of a game with 'X', 'O', or 'Stalemate' * start_player initialized as an empty string and updates at the start of a game with 'X' or 'O' * board initialized as our empty board dictionary * win_patterns the list of lists containing the winning patterns of the game and then we will have three different methods, each of which takes one parameter, self visualize_board check_winning check_stalemate : a new function. Returns \"It's a stalemate!\" and sets self.winner = \"Stalemate\" (note there is a bug \ud83d\udc1e in the way this is currently written, we will move along for now and work through a debugging tutorial later on!) Q1 Attributes of TicTacToe \u00b6 Within class TicTacToe, define the attributes described above class TicTacToe : # create winner and start_player parameters with default values as empty # strings within __init__ def __init__ ( self ): ################################## ########### Attributes ########### ################################## # set self.winner and self.start_player with the parameters from __init__ # set self.board as a dictionary with ' ' as values and 1-9 as keys # set self.win_patterns with the 8 winning patterns (a list of lists) Q2 Methods of TicTacToe \u00b6 Now we will define the methods of TicTacToe . Paste your attributes from the above cell, into the bellow cell so that your changes carry over. class TicTacToe : # create winner and start_player parameters with default values as empty # strings within __init__ def __init__ ( self ): ################################## ########### Attributes ########### ################################## # set self.winner and self.start_player with the parameters from __init__ # set self.board as a dictionary with ' ' as values and 1-9 as keys # set self.win_patterns with the 8 winning patterns (a list of lists) ############################### ########### METHODS ########### ############################### # the other functions are now passed self # define visualize_board and update the board # object with self.board (and maybe self.board.values() depending on how your # visualize_board function is written) # define check_winning and similarly update win_patterns, # board, and winner to be accessed via the self.

I've already done the heavy lifting of replacing references to attributes (board, win_patterns) and methods (visualize_board, check_winning) to pass through the TicTacToe object.

We also want to run our game system without having any input from the user for our data generation. This is a good point to reconfigure our code. Notice how long and bulky play_game is getting. Q4 Inheriting from TicTacToe \u00b6 To better organize our code, we're going to create a new class called GameEngine and we're going to inherit all the properties of TicTacToe .

Help your friend debug their code! Q1 Make the error repeatable \u00b6 In order to help with the debugging process, your friend realizes they need to show you the actual error in question. The problem, however, is that the random agent player is, well, random! To overcome this, they tell you to \"seed the random number generator with the value 12\" In the cell below, seed the random number generator using the number 12. Then create a GameEngine object with setup='auto' . Call the methods setup_game() and play_game() . Check to see that your output looks like the following: It's a stalemate! |X|O|X| |X|O|O| |O|O|X| # Cell for Q1 Q2 Check the Relevant Attributes and Function/Method Calls \u00b6 Now that we have made the error repeatable, let's check the internal states of the game object. Check the winner attribute as well as the methods check_stalemate() and check_winning() . You should get something like the following: >>> game.winner 'O' >>> game.check_stalemate() 'It's a stalemate!' >>> game.check_winning() ''O' Won!' # Cell for Q2 Q3 Make Changes to check_stalemate() \u00b6 We think we've zeroed-in on our problem! After running check_stalemate() on our board where it is evident that 'O' won, we find that our method returns 'It's a stalemate!' and furthermore, adjusts the winner attribute to be stalemate .

Write the same syntax in the empty cell below, and modify it to include parentheses in the right location so that the result/answer of the math is 3.0, rather than 15.0. 27 / ( 3 + 6 ) 3.0 Let's learn more operators beyond the ones we covered earlier. Write the line of code 3 ** 2 in the cell below. From the output, what do you think the double asterisks ( ** ) operator represents in Python? # represent to the power of (number after double asterisk) 3 ** 2 9 Write the line of code 28 / 3 below. Then just below the line in the same cell, write the code 28 // 3 . Compare the differences in output between the two. Can you decipher what // means in Python? 28 / 3 9.333333333333334 # // operator returns math.floor(division), aka the floor division 28 // 3 9 Now for more complicated mathematical operations! Try to write the Python equivalent of the following: \\frac{14 + 28}{28 - 14} ( 14 + 28 ) / ( 28 - 14 ) 3.0 Now try this one: \\frac{15 + 984}{-(217+4)} ( 15 + 984 ) / - ( 217 + 4 ) -4.520361990950226 And finally, write the Python equivalent for this: \\frac{-(3655 * 44)}{(8 * 16)^3} - ( 365 * 44 ) / ( 8 * 16 ) ** 3 -0.0076580047607421875 \ud83e\udd10 L1 Q3 Practice writing helpful comments \u00b6 Consider the following code below.

This is particularly well suited for tasks that would otherwise require a lot of memory to hold intermediary solutions (when they are combined with a strategy called memoization which we will shy away from here). The Fibonnaci sequence is a good place for such a problem. So is a factorial calculation. See here below 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 def factorial ( x ): \"\"\"This is a recursive function to find the factorial of an integer\"\"\" if x == 1 : return 1 else : # one trick to note that is common with recursive functions # is that the incrementation in the key variable is done # in the call to the function itself (vs a for loop) return ( x * factorial ( x - 1 )) n = 3 factorial ( n ) 6 In the above, we have on lines 5 and 6, what we call the baseline solution. It is the answer to the simplest subset of the problem. When we build a recursive tree, it is useful to think of the smallest problem, and work upwards, providing this leaf solution to nodes further up on the recursive tree. Like so: # 1! = 1 # 2! = 2 * 1! # 3! = 3 * 2! # N! = N * (N-1)! ... like ... like so This problem is intended to be a fun way to wrap our heads around functions... don't stress.

This is particularly well suited for tasks that would otherwise require a lot of memory to hold intermediary solutions (when they are combined with a strategy called memoization which we will shy away from here). The Fibonnaci sequence is a good place for such a problem. So is a factorial calculation. See here below 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 def factorial ( x ): \"\"\"This is a recursive function to find the factorial of an integer\"\"\" if x == 1 : return 1 else : # one trick to note that is common with recursive functions # is that the incrementation in the key variable is done # in the call to the function itself (vs a for loop) return ( x * factorial ( x - 1 )) n = 3 factorial ( n ) 6 In the above, we have on lines 5 and 6, what we call the baseline solution. It is the answer to the simplest subset of the problem. When we build a recursive tree, it is useful to think of the smallest problem, and work upwards, providing this leaf solution to nodes further up on the recursive tree. Like so: # 1! = 1 # 2! = 2 * 1! # 3! = 3 * 2! # N! = N * (N-1)! ... like ... like so This problem is intended to be a fun way to wrap our heads around functions... don't stress.

In order to complete this notebook you will have to have covered sessions 1-3 where we discuss python, conditionals/flow, and functions. 1.1 Defining and Visualizing the Board \u00b6 1.1 Q1 \u00b6 First we need to define our board object (object in the loose sense for now!). This will hold the memory of where our current player pieces are. Say we eventually want to place in every board position a string variable, 'X' or 'O' . How would we represent the board? Also, how do we represent it in the least complex space possible, i.e. a list? Example output: [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '] # cell for Q1 # create a variable called \"board\" and set it equal to a list of 9 strings # filled with a single white space board = [ ' ' , ' ' , ' ' , ' ' , ' ' , ' ' , ' ' , ' ' , ' ' ] board [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '] 1.1 Q2 \u00b6 We would like to be able to visualize where our players have executed onto the board. How can we use what we've learned about print functions to visualize an empty board? hint: use | , \\n , .format() , and unpack our board elements using an asteric ( *board ) with the print function. Example output: | | | | | | | | | | | | # Cell for Q2 # call the print() function on your board; if you can get your output to look # like the example in a single print() call, great! if not, don't worry! solve # this however you feel comfortable. Just make sure the output looks like the # example print ( \"| {} | {} | {} | \\n | {} | {} | {} | \\n | {} | {} | {} |\" . format ( * board )) | | | | | | | | | | | | 1.1 Q3 \u00b6 After you've created your print script that takes the board as an input, test it out by filling your board with some X's and O's Example output: |X| | | | |O| | | | | | # Cell for Q3 # now copy and paste your code from above, but before you run your script, fill # in an 'X' in the first (0-index) position of your board list and an 'O' in the # 4th (3-index) position board = [ 'X' , ' ' , ' ' , ' ' , 'O' , ' ' , ' ' , ' ' , ' ' ] print ( \"| {} | {} | {} | \\n | {} | {} | {} | \\n | {} | {} | {} |\" . format ( * board )) |X| | | | |O| | | | | | 1.1 Q4 \u00b6 Now, if that looks good, wrap the print function in a function called visualize_board that takes the variable board as a parameter. Example: visualize_board(board) |X| | | | |O| | | | | | # Cell for Q4 # now write a function called \"visualize_board\" that takes in your board object # as an input and prints out the board the way we just prototyped above. def visualize_board ( board ): print ( \"| {} | {} | {} | \\n | {} | {} | {} | \\n | {} | {} | {} |\" . format ( * board )) visualize_board ( board ) |X| | | | |O| | | | | | 1.1 Q5 \u00b6 It may be more useful to organize our board into a dictionary. Recreate your board variable now using integers 1-9 as the keys and empty strings ' ' as the values.

Write down all the winning patterns using our board representation where places are numbered 1-9. Store these patterns in a list of lists called win_patterns hint: You should identify 8 winning patterns # Cell for Q1 win_patterns = [[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ], [ 7 , 8 , 9 ], [ 1 , 5 , 9 ], [ 3 , 5 , 7 ], [ 1 , 4 , 7 ], [ 2 , 5 , 8 ], [ 3 , 6 , 9 ]] 1.2 Q2 \u00b6 Next, we will need to write a function that checks if there is a winning pattern on our board (i.e. all X's or all O's are in the indicated places on the board. But let's build the conditionals and logic methodically and not just jump into writing a for loop! First, access the first element of win_patterns and set it equal to a variable called pattern Example output: [1, 2, 3] # Cell for Q2 pattern = win_patterns [ 0 ] pattern [1, 2, 3] 1.2 Q3 \u00b6 Use the board dictionary to get the board values at the positions stored in pattern Example Output: ['X', ' ', ' '] # Cell for Q3 player_tokens = [] for i in pattern : player_tokens . append ( board [ i ]) player_tokens [' ', ' ', ' '] 1.2 Q4 \u00b6 Now check for whether they contain 3 X's or 3 O's. Fill those spaces with all 'X's or all 'O's to check that your conditional is working properly. Your output should be a boolean : True or False # Cell for Q4 board = init_board () board [ 1 ] = 'O' board [ 2 ] = 'O' board [ 3 ] = 'O' player_tokens = [] for i in pattern : player_tokens . append ( board [ i ]) if ( player_tokens == [ 'X' , 'X' , 'X' ]) or ( player_tokens == [ 'O' , 'O' , 'O' ]): print ( True ) else : print ( False ) True 1.2 Q5 \u00b6 Now we're ready to wrap this in a for loop. Loop through every pattern in win_patterns and evaluate with your conditional. If 'X' wins then print out 'X' Won! if 'O' wins then print out 'O' Won! Example output: 'O' Won! # Cell for Q5 board = init_board () board [ 1 ] = 'X' board [ 5 ] = 'X' board [ 9 ] = 'X' for pattern in win_patterns : player_tokens = [] for i in pattern : player_tokens . append ( board [ i ]) if ( player_tokens == [ 'X' , 'X' , 'X' ]): print ( \"'X' Won!\" ) elif ( player_tokens == [ 'O' , 'O' , 'O' ]): print ( \"'O' Won!\" ) else : pass 'X' Won! 1.2 Q6 \u00b6 Once we've detected a winner, there's no need to continue the for-loop. Put breaks in your loop so that it exits after detecting a winner # Cell for Q6 board = init_board () board [ 1 ] = 'X' board [ 5 ] = 'X' board [ 9 ] = 'X' for pattern in win_patterns : player_tokens = [] for i in pattern : player_tokens . append ( board [ i ]) if ( player_tokens == [ 'X' , 'X' , 'X' ]): print ( \"'X' Won!\" ) break elif ( player_tokens == [ 'O' , 'O' , 'O' ]): print ( \"'O' Won!\" ) break else : pass 'X' Won! 1.2 Q7 \u00b6 let's wrap this in a function. Call your function check_winning and have it take board as an input parameter. Make what were previously your print statements into returns of their respective strings. Return an empty string if there is no winner detected. # Cell for Q7 def check_winning ( board ): for pattern in win_patterns : player_tokens = [] for i in pattern : player_tokens . append ( board [ i ]) if ( player_tokens == [ 'X' , 'X' , 'X' ]): return \"'X' Won!\" elif ( player_tokens == [ 'O' , 'O' , 'O' ]): return \"'O' Won!\" else : pass return \"\" Check that your code works using a board that has either 'X' or 'O' as a winner. # Cell for Q7 board = init_board () board [ 1 ] = 'X' board [ 5 ] = 'X' board [ 9 ] = 'X' check_winning ( board ) \"'X' Won!\" 1.3 Input from the User \u00b6 We can get input from the user like so: move = input () 1 1.3 Q1 \u00b6 Let's ask the user for their move and create some logic to embed this into the board. First write your string that will be presented to the user, asking them to play their move. player = 'X' board = init_board () visualize_board ( board . values ()) # WRITE YOUR STRING DOWN HERE move = input ( \" {} , Choose your move\" . format ( player )) | | | | | | | | | | | | X, Choose your move1 1.3 Q2 \u00b6 Great. Now we need to check that the position is actually available to the user, if not, ask the user for a different move; otherwise update the board and ask for the next move from the next player hint: you will need to convert your input into an int to be able to use it as a key in the board dictionary ### COPY YOUR CODE FROM ABOVE ### player = 'X' board = init_board () board [ 1 ] = 'X' visualize_board ( board . values ()) # WRITE YOUR STRING DOWN HERE move = int ( input ( \" {} , Choose your move\" . format ( player ))) ### END COPY ### ### WRITE YOUR CONDITIONAL BELOW # note: you will need to think of both the conditional, as well as a method # to continue asking the player to make a move if the condition is not met # what kind of loop does this make you think of? while True : if board [ move ] != ' ' : move = int ( input ( \" {} , sorry that spot is taken! \\n Choose another move\" . format ( player ))) else : board [ move ] = player break ### END YOUR CODE winner = check_winning ( board ) |X| | | | | | | | | | | X, Choose your move1 X, sorry that spot is taken!

Fill in the blanks in the code cell below to complete the game handler: print ( \"'X' will go first!\" ) board = init_board () # initiate a while loop while True : # create a for loop that iterates between X and O and stores this in the # variable name `player` for player in ([ 'X' , 'O' ]): # visualize the board visualize_board ( board . values ()) ### PASTE YOUR CODE FROM ABOVE FOR ASKING THE PLAYER FOR THEIR MOVE ### move = int ( input ( \" {} , Choose your move\" . format ( player ))) while True : if board [ move ] != ' ' : move = int ( input ( \" {} , sorry that spot is taken! \\n Choose another move\" . format ( player ))) else : board [ move ] = player break ### END PASTE ### ### WRITE THE LOGIC TO BREAK OUT OF THE WHILE LOOP BELOW ### # check if there is a winner using check_winning # if the return from check_winning is an empty string, # then continue the while loop, otherwise break the while loop and print # the name of the winner (X or O) winner = check_winning ( board ) if winner == '' : continue else : print ( winner ) break # break out of outer loop if winner != '' : break 'X' will go first! | | | | | | | | | | | | X, Choose your move1 |X| | | | | | | | | | | O, Choose your move2 |X|O| | | | | | | | | | X, Choose your move4 |X|O| | |X| | | | | | | O, Choose your move3 |X|O|O| |X| | | | | | | X, Choose your move7 'X' Won! 1.5 In Summary \u00b6 Paste all your working functions into the cell below for safe keeping: def init_board (): return { 1 : ' ' , 2 : ' ' , 3 : ' ' , 4 : ' ' , 5 : ' ' , 6 : ' ' , 7 : ' ' , 8 : ' ' , 9 : ' ' ,} def visualize_board ( board ): print ( \"| {} | {} | {} | \\n | {} | {} | {} | \\n | {} | {} | {} |\" . format ( * board )) def check_winning ( board ): for pattern in win_patterns : player_tokens = [] for i in pattern : player_tokens . append ( board [ i ]) if ( player_tokens == [ 'X' , 'X' , 'X' ]): return \"'X' Won!\" elif ( player_tokens == [ 'O' , 'O' , 'O' ]): return \"'O' Won!\" else : pass return \"\" print ( \"'X' will go first!\" ) board = init_board () # initiate a while loop while True : # create a for loop that iterates between X and O and stores this in the # variable name `player` for player in ([ 'X' , 'O' ]): # visualize the board visualize_board ( board . values ()) ### PASTE YOUR CODE FROM ABOVE FOR ASKING THE PLAYER FOR THEIR MOVE ### move = int ( input ( \" {} , Choose your move\" . format ( player ))) while True : if board [ move ] != ' ' : move = int ( input ( \" {} , sorry that spot is taken! \\n Choose another move\" . format ( player ))) else : board [ move ] = player break ### END PASTE ### ### WRITE THE LOGIC TO BREAK OUT OF THE WHILE LOOP BELOW ### # check if there is a winner using check_winning # if the return from check_winning is an empty string, # then continue the while loop, otherwise break the while loop and print # the name of the winner (X or O) winner = check_winning ( board ) if winner == '' : continue else : print ( winner ) break # break out of outer loop if winner != '' : break","title":"SOLN P1 Building TicTacToe in Python"},{"location":"solutions/SOLN_P1_Building_TicTacToe_in_Python/#python-foundations-project-part-1-building-the-game-tic-tac-toe","text":"Instructor : Wesley Beckner Contact : wesleybeckner@gmail.com In this project notebook we'll be laying the foundations of our tic-tac-toe game!

In this class called TicTacToe we will have the attributes: * winner , initialized as an empty string, and updates at the conclusion of a game with 'X', 'O', or 'Stalemate' * start_player initialized as an empty string and updates at the start of a game with 'X' or 'O' * board initialized as our empty board dictionary * win_patterns the list of lists containing the winning patterns of the game and then we will have three different methods, each of which takes one parameter, self visualize_board check_winning check_stalemate : a new function. Returns \"It's a stalemate!\" and sets self.winner = \"Stalemate\" (note there is a bug \ud83d\udc1e in the way this is currently written, we will move along for now and work through a debugging tutorial later on!) Q1 Attributes of TicTacToe \u00b6 Within class TicTacToe, define the attributes described above class TicTacToe : # create winner and start_player parameters with default values as empty # strings within __init__ def __init__ ( self , winner = '' , start_player = '' ): ################################## ########### Attributes ########### ################################## # set self.winner and self.start_player with the parameters from __init__ self . winner = winner self . start_player = start_player # set self.board as a dictionary with ' ' as values and 1-9 as keys self . board = { 1 : ' ' , 2 : ' ' , 3 : ' ' , 4 : ' ' , 5 : ' ' , 6 : ' ' , 7 : ' ' , 8 : ' ' , 9 : ' ' ,} # set self.win_patterns with the 8 winning patterns (a list of lists) self . win_patterns = [[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ], [ 7 , 8 , 9 ], [ 1 , 4 , 7 ], [ 2 , 5 , 8 ], [ 3 , 6 , 9 ], [ 1 , 5 , 9 ], [ 7 , 5 , 3 ]] Q2 Methods of TicTacToe \u00b6 Now we will define the methods of TicTacToe . Paste your attributes from the above cell, into the bellow cell so that your changes carry over. class TicTacToe : # create winner and start_player parameters with default values as empty # strings within __init__ def __init__ ( self , winner = '' , start_player = '' ): ################################## ########### Attributes ########### ################################## # set self.winner and self.start_player with the parameters from __init__ self . winner = winner self . start_player = start_player # set self.board as a dictionary with ' ' as values and 1-9 as keys self . board = { 1 : ' ' , 2 : ' ' , 3 : ' ' , 4 : ' ' , 5 : ' ' , 6 : ' ' , 7 : ' ' , 8 : ' ' , 9 : ' ' ,} # set self.win_patterns with the 8 winning patterns (a list of lists) self . win_patterns = [[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ], [ 7 , 8 , 9 ], [ 1 , 4 , 7 ], [ 2 , 5 , 8 ], [ 3 , 6 , 9 ], [ 1 , 5 , 9 ], [ 7 , 5 , 3 ]] ############################### ########### METHODS ########### ############################### # the other functions are now passed self # define visualize_board (you will probably need to change \"board\" to # self.board.values() depending on how your visualize_board() function is # written) def visualize_board ( self ): \"\"\" Visualizes the board during gameplay Parameters ---------- board_values : list The values ('X', 'O', or ' ' at each board location) Returns ------- None \"\"\" print ( \"| {} | {} | {} | \\n | {} | {} | {} | \\n | {} | {} | {} | \\n \" . format ( * self . board . values ()) ) def init_board ( self ): \"\"\" Initializes an empty board for the start of gameplay Parameters ---------- None Returns ------- board : dict a dictionary with keys 1-9 and single space (' ') string as values \"\"\" self . board = { 1 : ' ' , 2 : ' ' , 3 : ' ' , 4 : ' ' , 5 : ' ' , 6 : ' ' , 7 : ' ' , 8 : ' ' , 9 : ' ' ,} # define check_winning and make sure win_patterns, # board, and winner are accessed via the self within the function call. # Update the attribute self.winner with the appropriate winner in the function def check_winning ( self ): \"\"\" Checks if the game has a winner Parameters ---------- board : dict the tictactoe board as a dictionary Returns ------- win_statement : str defaults to an empty string if no winner.

I've already done the heavy lifting of replacing references to attributes (board, win_patterns) and methods (visualize_board, check_winning) to pass through the TicTacToe object. I also added the option for the user to quit the game by typing in 'q' to the input line if they would like. Q3 Add Condition for Stalemate \u00b6 def play_game (): print ( \"'X' will go first!\" ) tic_tac_toe = TicTacToe () while True : for player in ([ 'X' , 'O' ]): tic_tac_toe . visualize_board () move = input ( \" {} , what's your move?\" . format ( player )) #################################################################### # we're going to allow the user to quit the game from the input line #################################################################### if move in [ 'q' , 'quit' ]: tic_tac_toe . winner = 'F' print ( 'quiting the game' ) break move = int ( move ) if tic_tac_toe . board [ move ] != ' ' : while True : move = input ( \" {} , that position is already taken! \" \\ \"What's your move?\" . format ( player )) move = int ( move ) if tic_tac_toe . board [ move ] != ' ' : continue else : break tic_tac_toe . board [ move ] = player # the winner varaible will now be checked within the board object tic_tac_toe . check_winning () ############################## # CALL check_stalemate() BELOW ############################## tic_tac_toe . check_stalemate () if tic_tac_toe . winner == '' : continue ########################################################################## # write an elif statement that checks if self.winner is 'Stalemate' and # subsequently visualizes the board and breaks out of the while loop # also print out check_stalemate so the returned string is shown to the # user ########################################################################## else : print ( tic_tac_toe . check_winning ()) tic_tac_toe . visualize_board () break if tic_tac_toe . winner != '' : break Let's test our new module play_game () 'X' will go first! | | | | | | | | | | | | X, what's your move?1 |X| | | | | | | | | | | O, what's your move?2 |X|O| | | | | | | | | | X, what's your move?4 |X|O| | |X| | | | | | | O, what's your move?5 |X|O| | |X|O| | | | | | X, what's your move?7 'X' Won! |X|O| | |X|O| | |X| | |","title":"SOLN P2 OOP in TicTacToe"},{"location":"solutions/SOLN_P2_OOP_in_TicTacToe/#python-foundations-project-part-2-object-oriented-programming","text":"Instructor : Wesley Beckner Contact : wesleybeckner@gmail.com In part II of our tic-tac-toe and AI journey, we're going to take all the functions we've defined so far and make them object oriented!","title":"Python Foundations  Project Part 2: Object Oriented Programming"},{"location":"solutions/SOLN_P2_OOP_in_TicTacToe/#20-preparing-environment-and-importing-data","text":"back to top","title":"2.0 Preparing Environment and Importing Data"},{"location":"solutions/SOLN_P2_OOP_in_TicTacToe/#201-import-packages","text":"back to top def visualize_board ( board_values ): \"\"\" Visualizes the board during gameplay Parameters ---------- board_values : list The values ('X', 'O', or ' ' at each board location) Returns ------- None \"\"\" print ( \"| {} | {} | {} | \\n | {} | {} | {} | \\n | {} | {} | {} | \\n \" . format ( * board_values ) ) def init_board (): \"\"\" Initializes an empty board for the start of gameplay Parameters ---------- None Returns ------- board : dict a dictionary with keys 1-9 and single space (' ') string as values \"\"\" return { 1 : ' ' , 2 : ' ' , 3 : ' ' , 4 : ' ' , 5 : ' ' , 6 : ' ' , 7 : ' ' , 8 : ' ' , 9 : ' ' ,} # the keys on the game board where, if filled completely with X's or O's a # winner has occurred win_patterns = [[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ], [ 7 , 8 , 9 ], [ 1 , 4 , 7 ], [ 2 , 5 , 8 ], [ 3 , 6 , 9 ], [ 1 , 5 , 9 ], [ 7 , 5 , 3 ]] def check_winning ( board ): \"\"\" Checks if the game has a winner Parameters ---------- board : dict the tictactoe board as a dictionary Returns ------- win_statement : str defaults to an empty string if no winner.

We need to check if a random number that's been drawn is a valid move. We're going to do this with... yeah that's right you guessed it, a while loop while True : # generate a random number 1-9 and set it equal to the variable name <move> move = random . randint ( 1 , 9 ) if board [ move ] != ' ' : # if the move is invalid then... continue else : # otherwise the move is valid and we can exit the loop! break Wow and that's it, we just need to wrap it in our play_game function. Before we do that, we need to handle the ability of our engine to perform 1 and 2 player games. In order to do this, I'm going to introduce a new object to organize how the game is setup. I'm going to call it player_meta player_meta = {'first': {'label': 'X', 'type': 'human'}, 'second': {'label': 'O', 'type': 'human'}} Note that in the above player_meta I have 'type' specificed to 'human' , the other player 'type' will be 'ai' !

We'll use this feature to record a bunch of games and generate some data for analysis and, eventually, machine learning. We also want to run our game system without having any input from the user for our data generation. This is a good point to reconfigure our code. Notice how long and bulky play_game is getting. Q4 Inheriting from TicTacToe \u00b6 To better organize our code, we're going to create a new class called GameEngine and we're going to inherit all the properties of TicTacToe . Do we remember how to do this? let's try it. The simplest way is the following: class GameEngine(TicTacToe): def __init__(self): super().__init__() Nice. Pretty clean, right?

Help your friend debug their code! Q1 Make the error repeatable \u00b6 In order to help with the debugging process, your friend realizes they need to show you the actual error in question. The problem, however, is that the random agent player is, well, random! To overcome this, they tell you to \"seed the random number generator with the value 12\" In the cell below, seed the random number generator using the number 12. Then create a GameEngine object with setup='auto' . Call the methods setup_game() and play_game() . Check to see that your output looks like the following: It's a stalemate! |X|O|X| |X|O|O| |O|O|X| # Cell for Q1 random . seed ( 12 ) game = GameEngine ( setup = 'auto' ) game . setup_game () game . play_game () | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |O| | | | | | | | | | | |O| | | | |X| | | | | | |O|O| | | |X| | | |X| | |O|O| | | |X| | | |X| | |O|O| |O| |X| |X| |X| | |O|O| |O| |X| |X| |X| | |O|O| |O|O|X| |X| |X| |X|O|O| |O|O|X| It's a stalemate! |X|O|X| |X|O|O| |O|O|X| <__main__.GameEngine at 0x7f0692cda450> Q2 Check the Relevant Attributes and Function/Method Calls \u00b6 Now that we have made the error repeatable, let's check the internal states of the game object. Check the winner attribute as well as the methods check_stalemate() and check_winning() . You should get something like the following: >>> game.winner 'O' >>> game.check_stalemate() 'It's a stalemate!' >>> game.check_winning() ''O' Won!' # Cell for Q2 print ( game . winner ) print ( game . check_stalemate ()) print ( game . winner ) print ( game . check_winning ()) print ( game . winner ) Stalemate It's a stalemate! Stalemate 'O' Won! O Q3 Make Changes to check_stalemate() \u00b6 We think we've zeroed-in on our problem! After running check_stalemate() on our board where it is evident that 'O' won, we find that our method returns 'It's a stalemate!' and furthermore, adjusts the winner attribute to be stalemate . We need to adjust this method so that it properly assess a stalemate ONLY when there is no winner.

Image borrowed from nobledesktop.com Simplicity Excel GUI makes simple calculations, well simple! Many are at least somewhat versed, so sharing is simple too! Python Steeper learning curve This is unavoidable, but to our advantage our learning material is currated so that we learn python while solving relevant problems! You need to setup your own coding environment (Thanks Colab!) Automation / Data Connectivity Excel Need to execute xlsx file with relevant data (copy, paste, edit, paradigm) Python Integration with databases for easy update, chart or analysis delivery Scalability & Big Data Excel less than millions of data points poor version control Python more than millions of data points can integrate with querying languages (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL) has version control and containerized environments (like notebooks) extraction, wrangling, and analytics all in one place Side Note: The scripting language of Excel is VBA, this won first place (80% of developers who use this language stated) for most dread language!! in stack overflow's 2020 developer survey That being said, we won't only approach Python from a let's-replace-excel standpoint; we will also be approaching it from a coding standpoint: we write computer code to perform a set of tasks and instructions that the computer can help us accomplish . The real challenge and process of coding from an engineering perspective is how to codify a problem, and knowledge of what tools are available to solve it. I, and the TA's I have had in the past, have worked hard on this material to demystify the confusion along the way, while focusing on giving learning experiences in the relevant engineering and business problem areas. 1.1.1 Python vs other languages \u00b6 Our goal is to not only give an introduction to Python, but also to demonstrate general coding concepts. For these next few sections, we'll be executing various lines of code right here in this interactive, Google Colab notebook. If you're wondering how this is possible and how this all works, don't worry; we'll get to the intricacies of interactive notebooks later! You'll discover the many benefits of this general purpose programming language. In particular, The syntax for Python is understandable to read and easy to learn , compared to the syntax of other languages that requires more of a background of underlying computer science - languages such as Java, C, and C++. In this course, you'll discover that Python is especially ideal for working with scientific data. Topics such as data manipulation and visualization will be covered later on this week - all while continuing to utilize Python. # We will talk about what this cell is doing in a moment! ! python -- version Python 3.7.12 Note: this session is covering syntax for version 3.x of Python. As you continue learning Python elsewhere, please advise that Python version 2 is no longer supported, and older notebooks may be outdated as a result. source: insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020 1.1.2 A quick primer on Python syntax \u00b6 Python's simple, concise syntax allows for faster prototyping of code than other languages such as Java and C++. (However, that does not mean that Python has faster runtime execution than the others!) Printing output to the console is as simple as running Python's built-in print() function. To execute a code cell (we'll talk more about this later!), you can either click on the Play button next to the cell, or use the keyboard shortcut CTRL + ENTER ( CMD (\u2318) + ENTER on a macOS). print ( \"Hello, GIX Students. Here are my changes\" ) Hello, GIX Students. Here are my changes Variables can be created just by typing the name you'd like, followed by the equal sign, and the value you want to assign the variable to. In this case, we'll create a variable called some_school and set it to the value of \"University of Washington\" : some_school = \"University of Washington\" You may then use created variables elsewhere. For example, we can output the value set for some_school by inputting the variable name into Python's print() function: print ( some_school ) University of Washington A key part of coding is understanding which functions you need to use for accomplishing a task, as well as knowing when to create one of your own, which you'll learn more about later this week. For now, what you should know is that print() from earlier is one example of calling/executing a function that's already made available to us. \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 1: A Very Common Print Statement \u00b6 Now that you've stepped through our quick primer on Python, for our first coding exercise, try printing hello world! to the screen. Then run the code cell either from the Play button or the keyboard shortcut from earlier to see the output. You may have noticed me making new coding blocks without touching my mouse. You can do this by pressing esc then a or esc then b (for above/below) to create a new cell block where your cursor is. Try this as well # Cell for Exercise 1 print ( \"hello world!\" ) hello world! 1.1.3 What are variables? \u00b6 To have values that our computer can store in memory, we use variables . How else can we store information for later analysis and later reference? That's where variables come in, and is an essential part of programming! Here's a basic example of assigning a variable, using '='. Let's call this variable x and assign it an integer value (we'll get to integers in just a bit!) of 25: x = 25 Let's create another variable called city_name and assign it the word \"Seattle\" : city_name = \"Seattle\" And when we need to use this value again, we retrieve that variable by referring to it by the variable name we gave it when first assigned. The x variable we created earlier can now be used later, and as many times as we'd like. Existing variables can also be modified. Let's change the value of x , after printing its initial value: print ( x ) x = 150 print ( x ) 150 150 A few more notes on storing data as variables... Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory for that value. You can identify the location in memory using names. Rules: Must begin with a letter (a - z, A - B) or underscore (_) Other characters can be letters, numbers or _ Case Sensitive Can be any (reasonable) length There are some reserved words which you cannot use as a variable name because Python uses them for other things. (e.g False, None, True, Lambda, From, Global) If you want to have more than one word in the name, the convention is to use underscore \"_\" in the name. there was a time when camelCase was also acceptable 1.1.3.1 Variable types \u00b6 For your reference... Data Types Numbers floating point integers complex numbers strings boolean values lists and dicts NoneType In this section we will also introduce a built-in python function type() Let's explore some common variable data types in Python. The first type to discuss is a string , which we've already seen before when we initialized city_name . Strings in Python are simply a collection of characters wrapped around quotes, and a string can represent any kind of info depending on how it's used, such as a person's name, a city name (like we just demonstrated), or a complete sentence. Here are some examples of string variables in Python below. ... we can also use single or double quotes ... and triple quotes open whole blocks of string content some_school = \"University of Washington\" ''' this is a string a line here a line there etc... ''' ''' here's a stirng block with triple singles ''' \"\\nhere's a stirng block\\n with triple singles\\n\" 'single quotes' 'single quotes' \"double quotes\" 'double quotes' you have to use double quotes here... \"patrick said = 'here's what patrick' \" \"here's one with a single quote inside\" \"here's one with a single quote inside\" \"\"\" heres a block with double triples \"\"\" '\\nheres \\na block with \\ndouble triples\\n' print ( \"here's some text \\\\ n here's some more text\" ) here's some text\\n here's some more text type ( \"heres a string... I think?!@?!?!\" ) str The other variable types we'll discuss for now are integers and floats . Consider the Integer type as data that can represent any positive whole number or negative whole number. Recall the x variable we assigned to 25 and then 150 earlier? That variable would be considered an integer in Python. Here are some other quick examples of Python integer variables. some_int = 5 numbers_of_breakfasts_for_hobbits = 2 # notice the usefulness of tab complete for long variable names! type ( numbers_of_breakfasts_for_hobbits ) int print ( \"what about second breakfast???\" ) what about second breakfast??? A float in Python is considered any number with decimal point values. This is the main difference between a float and integer. For floats, some examples below show an arbitrary number of decimal places after the decimal point, and ones where a value less than 1 (such as one representing a percentage value) don't require specifying a 0 left of the decimal point. # what do we notice is different here? y = 21.0 half = .5 data_generated_by_deathstar = 2.08 #exabytes/year star wars source # let's try something... print ( type ( 21.0 )) print ( type ( 21 )) <class 'float'> <class 'int'> We see that python auto-determines variable datatypes for us, in many cases! Python is a programming language in which variables are dynamically typed, meaning we do not need to declare the specific type of the variable when we initialize it . Because of this feature of Python, executing x = 21 will automatically turn this variable into an integer by default due to its value of 21. Likewise, executing x = 21.0 instead will make x the float type. \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 2: Create and change some variables \u00b6 Start by initializing a variable named hundred and assign it an integer value of 100 in the code cell below. THEN print the type of the stored variable # Cell for Exercise 2 hundred = 100 print ( type ( hundred )) <class 'int'> Now create another variable called largest_computer_in_the_galaxy and assign it the string value of \"Deep Thought\" in the code cell below. THEN print the stored variable # Cell for Exercise 2 largest_computer_in_the_galaxy = \"Deep Thought\" print ( largest_computer_in_the_galaxy ) Deep Thought There are many more variable types to explore in Python, both ones built-in to Python and ones created by open-source libraries. The later sessions will cover more of these types, such as lists and DataFrames in session 2. 1.1.4 Math with Python (the moment I've been waiting for...) \u00b6 1.1.4.1 Basic operators \u00b6 Python allows users to performing mathematical operations fairly easily. As many tutorials will explain, you can use Python just like a calculator! The most basic operation, adding 1 with 1, is as follows, using the plus sign ( + ) for addition: 1 + 1 2 Subtraction is done with the minus sign in Python ( - ) and also works as expected here: 45 - 32 13 Multiplication is performed by the asterisk sign ( * ) in Python: 12 * 90 1080 You may combine as many arithmetic operators in one line as you need: 8 + 5 * 14 - 7 + 14 * 3 - 10 103 And based on the data type, you can peform the same mathematical operations for variables. Suppose a = 12 and b = 24 are already defined, we can multiply the two variables together by simply referring to their names and using Python's multiplication operator: a * b . a = 12 b = 24 a * b 288 \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 3: Discover More Operators On Your Own! \u00b6 Beyond the three arithmetic operators we have just demonstrated, there are more in Python to discover. To start, try typing 14 / 4 in the empty code cell below: # Cell for Exercise 3 14 / 4 # BAD PYTHON 12 + 5 / 6 * 7 + 4 21.833333333333336 Just by typing the computation and seeing the output on your own, you can quickly recognize that / is a division operator. Now try 14 % 4 in the empty code below. From the output, can you guess what the % sign in Python accomplishes here? # Cell for Exercise 3 16 % 3 1 \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 4: Order of Operations \u00b6 Be aware that order or operations apply for programming as well, and Python is no exception. Python follows operator precedence, specifically PEMDAS - any operations in parentheses ( P ) take precedence, followed by exponents ( E ), multiplication ( M ) & division ( D ), and then addition ( A ) & subtraction ( S ). Run the following code: 4 * 3 + 4 16 While that was straightforward, let's modify it to wrap parentheses around 3 + 4 . When you execute the code cell below, what output do you receive now? 4 * ( 3 + 4 ) 28 1.1.4.2 Enrichment : The difference between 5, 5.0, and \"5\" \u00b6 While more complex computations are possible beyond the basics that we just covered, you should first understand how mixing variable types can lead to errors and unexpected output. Consider two variables, num1 = 5 and num2 = 5.0 . From what you learned in section 1.1.3, num1 represents an integer, while num2 represents a float. num1 = 5 num2 = 5.0 For this example, what happens when we add num1 and num2 together in Python, as in, run the code num1 + num2 ? type ( num1 + num2 ) float As you see from the output of that operation, the result is 10.0, which is a float. What this means is that for any operation that uses a float type in Python, the default type of the result will also be a float . In this example, mixing an integer ( num1 ) and float ( num2 ) together by addition resulted in 10.0 and not 10, even if the sum is a whole number. Although mixing the two data types did not cause a runtime error, you should recognize this behavior in the near future, when such computations result in output that you may not expect - and possibly lead you to some functionality that causes an error elsewhere. Finally, let's discuss a third variable, called num3 , and let's assign it a value of \"5\" . num3 = \"5\" type ( num3 ) str If we try adding num1 with num3 , or 5 + \"5\", what is our output now from the code num1 + num3 ? # num1 + num3 The output is neither a 10 or a 10.0 - instead, we receive a TypeError. Python does not allow you to perform mathematical operations with an integer and string together . Because num1 is an integer, and num3 is a string type - given the double quotes around 5 - adding the two together in Python results in this TypeError, even if the string represents a numeric character. The same goes for combining floats with strings: is our output from the code num2 (float) and num3 (string) any different? # num2 + num3 Nope! Same TypeError results here. One workaround/solution for this is converting ( type casting ) the num3 string variable into either a float or a integer, using Python's built-in float() and int() functions respectively. Let's try adding num1 and num3 again, only this time using int() to convert num3 into an integer type, running the full line of code as num1 + int(num3) . num3 '5' num1 + int ( num3 ) 10 int ( num3 ) 5 This time, we get no TypeError - the output is 10! Without diving too much further into the intricacies of these conversion functions - the concept of functions themselves will be covered in more detail in session 3! - just be aware that this example only works because the string represented by num3 was a valid convertible string (\"5\") to begin with. In other words, if num3 was \"Five\" instead of \"5\", we would not be able to execute int(num3) without getting an error. # num3 = \"Five\" # int(num3) 1.1.5 Code comments with '#' \u00b6 Comments are notes in your code, and can serve many purposes, such as: - Describing the functionality of some code - A reminder to fix an existing issue - Clarify details of some code for yourself and/or others You can create a comment by using '#', and when the Python interpreter sees this syntax, it doesn't run that as code and recognizes it as a comment instead . For example, for a mathematical operation, let's add a comment at the end of the line to describe what this performs: 2 + 5 # Adds 2 to 5, so we get 7 7 In this case, the # Adds 2 to 5, so we get 7 part of the previous line of code was a comment appended to the end of the Python code, 2 + 5 . By adding that '#' character, Python knows everything after that character is a comment. Additionally, you can write comments on their own line(s) of code: # Adds 2 to 5, so we get 7 # Adds 2 to 5, so we get 7 # Adds 2 to 5, so we get 7 # # Adds 2 to 5, so we get 7 # Adds 2 to 5, so we get 7 # Adds 2 to 5, so we get 2 + 5 7 You may use this syntax for code that you may not want to execute, but still save for future reference or revision. To do this, you can simply add '#' at the very beginning of the line you wish to comment. In the following example, I've turned the first line of the code in this cell into a comment so it won't run: print ( \"I commented out this line of code so you won't see this statement printed\" ) print ( \"There should be one line printed from this cell, and should be this one.\" ) I commented out this line of code so you won't see this statement printed There should be one line printed from this cell, and should be this one. we can toggle comments with ctrl + / \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 5: Add a comment to a line of code \u00b6 Let's write a comment that explains the following line of code, 25 % 7 . 25 % 7 # returns the modulus of 25 and 7 4 Comments in your code are optional, but are recommended to help better inform readers of your code. Building a habit of writing comments may even help you understand and better explain your own code too! 1.1.6 Where can you run Python? \u00b6 Because of its flexibility as a programming language, Python can be utilized in many different ways. Here are just a few: Line by line in a Python interpreter in a command line Terminal window windows: windows subsystem for linux mac os: terminal As a script that you execute from the command line Using Python to create a full GUI (Graphical User Interface) that runs on your desktop computer Executing Python directly from an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as PyCharm , Atom , or Visual Studio Code Executing Python code with an app that has a built-in Python interpreter, such as Pythonista Developing and running Python code in interactive notebooks like Jupyter Notebook/Hub/Lab Executing Python on a cloud platform - such as here in this Jupyter Hub ( Google Colab is another free resource) You don't need to understand every example that was just listed. Instead, the point is for us to recognize how ubiquitous Python has become. We're about to focus on the last two items on this list in the very next section! There's much more to learn with Python! So far, we've only introduced a small fraction of what's possible with this language and, more generally speaking, coding. 1.2 Executing Python and runtime environments \u00b6 1.2.1 Using interactive notebooks \u00b6 After just having discussed the many ways you can deploy and develop Python, we'll focus on the one way that will be used for our sessions this week: interactive Python notebooks. Such notebooks - like the one you're viewing right now - are self-contained collections of interactive cells that can be modified and presented like a scientific notebook. By allowing us to combine code with formattable text, images, and interactive data visualizations, this gives us a great way to share and collaborate with others on our work. We'll next explore the proper interactive Python notebook type that you'll get quite familiar with during this series: Jupyter Notebooks. 1.2.2 Jupyter Notebooks \u00b6 Jupyter Notebooks is based on IPython, or Interactive Python. In fact, Jupyter notebooks were formerly known as IPython notebooks. Discussing the underlying IPython kernel which powers these notebooks is beyond the scope of this session; however, it's important to, at least, recognize where the .ipynb filename extension comes from. With Jupyter Notebooks, we can utilize the Python language right in a single self-contained environment of code, such as initializing and managing variables : var1 = \"A\" var2 = \"B\" var3 = [ \"A\" , \"B\" , \"C\" ] type ( var3 ) list We can also write functions that can be used later on in a notebook: # we were using built-in functions before. # but we can also define our own! def some_function ( x , y ): return x ** 2 / y ** 2 print ( some_function ( 7 , 12 )) 0.3402777777777778 Visualizations - such as scatterplots, heatmaps, and charts - can also be generated directly inside of a Jupyter notebook as a cell output, and can be saved as a separate image file. This also makes notebooks useful to generate both visual representations of data and interactive reports on that same data. We'll be covering visualizations in Session 6. from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x , y = make_blobs ( n_samples = 500 , n_features = 3 , centers = 3 ) plt . scatter ( x [:, 0 ], x [:, 1 ], marker = 'o' , c = y , s = 10 ) plt . title ( \"Example visualization\" ) plt . show () We certainly recognize that much of the code you have just seen may be unfamiliar to you, but these are all simply previews of what we'll be covering for this week! Here are some examples of how Jupyter Notebooks can be utilized: Reports on data analyses Data visualizations Interactive dashboards 1.2.3 Code cells vs markdown cells \u00b6 There are two main types of generated cells in Jupyter notebooks: code cells and markdown cells. You've seen both at this point. Right now, you're looking a markdown cell that's been created already by a different user. Think of a cell as just a single entity of your larger work inside of a notebook. Let's start with taking a look at code cells. 1.2.3.1 Code cells \u00b6 For writing and executing Python in a notebook, we use code cells. It may sound almost too self-explanatory, and you've already tried out code cells in the exercises from 1.1. To add a new code cell, you can either go to the Insert menu and selecting Code cell : Or by hovering your mouse over to the bottom of a cell and select + Code : And lastly. For code blocks, we can simply hit esc + a to enter a code block above or esc + b to enter a code block below. I just learned this! Just kidding one last note... we can delete a block by holding ctrl + m + d \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 6: Edit A Code Cell \u00b6 So far in this session, you've been creating entirely new code cells to write and execute a few exercises. Now, let's edit an existing cell of Python code. Below, we had our obligatory first exercise that printed \"Hello World!\" as the output. However, the code below, print(\"Hello World!\" causes an error, and does not output \"Hello World!\" as we initially expected. What do we need at the very end of the line in order for the print statement to run successfully? Note: I also want you to uncomment the following cell block! (how do we do that?) print ( \"Hello World!\" ) Hello World! Code cells exemplify one possible benefit of running your code in a notebook rather than in a single Python script (.py) file; you can create separate code cells and execute each portion your code separately and as needed. That also means being able to troubleshoot certain lines of code without having to rerun your entire work every time. 1.2.3.2 Markdown/Text cells \u00b6 As the name suggests, a text cell is meant for information and instructions, rather than executing code for assigning variables, importing datasets, or generating plots. One benefit of adding text cells is to help explain code or functionality to viewers of a notebook. You can add a text cell either by going to the Insert menu and selecting Text cell : Or by hovering your mouse over to the bottom of a cell and selecting + Text : You may edit an existing text cell by just double-clicking on one and editing the code. You can also have as many text cells as you want, cells that comprise technically any word length. Depending on what purpose it needs to serve, such cells may be a description of a data pipeline, or a list of external links (like the ones you'll see at the end of this notebook). \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 7: Write a very UW Text cell \u00b6 Create a simple text cell that reads the official tagline of UW (hint: https://www.washington.edu/brand/brand-guide/tagline/ ) text cell for exercise 7 Now Matters 1.2.3.3 Markdown for text cells \u00b6 Text cells support Markdown syntax, which is a way to render and format plain text, in addition to giving us more control to structure this text beyond just visually. Markdown is optional and enables you to transform and annotate text within a webpage or here in a Jupyter notebook. For text cells, using Markdown improves readability, as a set of formatting conventions that's easy to learn and write . Markdown is a superset of HTML. Discussing HTML is beyond the scope of this session, but there are links to read more about this, later in the notebook. \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 8: Discover some Markdown syntax \u00b6 Create a new text cell below with the UW official tagline like before, only this time play around with: ##### at the beginning of the first line (hit enter after) ** surounding portions of the text * surounding portions of the text > on a new line for the last line (hit enter before) text cell for exercise 8 Now Matters \u00b6 Now Matters Now Matters Now Matters Now Matters Later in the lab for this session, you'll learn more formatting syntax with Markdown. We also recommend trying out Markdown on a blank new Jupyter notebook for you to experiment with the all the different formatting this markup language has to offer. There is much more to discover with Markdown, and the References section of this notebook gives you a list of resources to learn more. \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 9: Always double check the type of cell you're running \u00b6 # It can be easy to mistakenly write something in a code cell, when you actually # wanted a text cell instead. For example... what happens when you hit the Play # button on this particular cell? 1.2.4 Other details on Jupyter Notebooks \u00b6 Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) don't just work with web browsers There are IDEs such as Visual Studio Code that have extensions which allow you to create and these .ipynb files right on the editor. Python isn't the only language supported by Jupyter, as you can also run notebooks with R and Julia as well, by adding specific computing engines for them. Notebooks - both in Jupyter and Google Colab - can integrate directly with GitHub repositories link to GitHub 1.2.5 ...So what does this have to do with Google Colab? \u00b6 Google Colab is based on Jupyter Notebook. Both the notebook platform and the development machine are hosted on the cloud - no need to install Python or external libraries locally on your computer! We'll be using Google Colab for this course. That includes all exercises and projects. Google Colab comes with pre-configured images with Python libraries pre-installed. Some of the most popular scientific libraries include: - NumPy - SciPy - Pandas - Scikit-Learn - TensorFlow - Matplotlib To view the full list of installed packages, run the following command: ! pip

You'll discover the many benefits of this general purpose programming language. In particular, The syntax for Python is understandable to read and easy to learn , compared to the syntax of other languages that requires more of a background of underlying computer science - languages such as Java, C, and C++.

How else can we store information for later analysis and later reference? That's where variables come in, and is an essential part of programming! Here's a basic example of assigning a variable, using '='. Let's call this variable x and assign it an integer value (we'll get to integers in just a bit!) of 25: x = 25 Let's create another variable called city_name and assign it the word \"Seattle\" : city_name = \"Seattle\" And when we need to use this value again, we retrieve that variable by referring to it by the variable name we gave it when first assigned. The x variable we created earlier can now be used later, and as many times as we'd like. Existing variables can also be modified. Let's change the value of x , after printing its initial value: print ( x ) x = 150 print ( x ) 150 150 A few more notes on storing data as variables... Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory for that value. You can identify the location in memory using names. Rules: Must begin with a letter (a - z, A - B) or underscore (_) Other characters can be letters, numbers or _ Case Sensitive Can be any (reasonable) length There are some reserved words which you cannot use as a variable name because Python uses them for other things. (e.g False, None, True, Lambda, From, Global) If you want to have more than one word in the name, the convention is to use underscore \"_\" in the name. there was a time when camelCase was also acceptable","title":"1.1.3 What are variables?"},{"location":"solutions/SOLN_S1_Python_and_Jupyter/#1131-variable-types","text":"For your reference... Data Types Numbers floating point integers complex numbers strings boolean values lists and dicts NoneType In this section we will also introduce a built-in python function type() Let's explore some common variable data types in Python. The first type to discuss is a string , which we've already seen before when we initialized city_name . Strings in Python are simply a collection of characters wrapped around quotes, and a string can represent any kind of info depending on how it's used, such as a person's name, a city name (like we just demonstrated), or a complete sentence. Here are some examples of string variables in Python below. ... we can also use single or double quotes ... and triple quotes open whole blocks of string content some_school = \"University of Washington\" ''' this is a string a line here a line there etc... ''' ''' here's a stirng block with triple singles ''' \"\\nhere's a stirng block\\n with triple singles\\n\" 'single quotes' 'single quotes' \"double quotes\" 'double quotes' you have to use double quotes here... \"patrick said = 'here's what patrick' \" \"here's one with a single quote inside\" \"here's one with a single quote inside\" \"\"\" heres a block with double triples \"\"\" '\\nheres \\na block with \\ndouble triples\\n' print ( \"here's some text \\\\ n here's some more text\" ) here's some text\\n here's some more text type ( \"heres a string... I think?!@?!?!\" ) str The other variable types we'll discuss for now are integers and floats . Consider the Integer type as data that can represent any positive whole number or negative whole number. Recall the x variable we assigned to 25 and then 150 earlier? That variable would be considered an integer in Python. Here are some other quick examples of Python integer variables. some_int = 5 numbers_of_breakfasts_for_hobbits = 2 # notice the usefulness of tab complete for long variable names! type ( numbers_of_breakfasts_for_hobbits ) int print ( \"what about second breakfast???\" ) what about second breakfast??? A float in Python is considered any number with decimal point values. This is the main difference between a float and integer. For floats, some examples below show an arbitrary number of decimal places after the decimal point, and ones where a value less than 1 (such as one representing a percentage value) don't require specifying a 0 left of the decimal point. # what do we notice is different here? y = 21.0 half = .5 data_generated_by_deathstar = 2.08 #exabytes/year star wars source # let's try something... print ( type ( 21.0 )) print ( type ( 21 )) <class 'float'> <class 'int'> We see that python auto-determines variable datatypes for us, in many cases! Python is a programming language in which variables are dynamically typed, meaning we do not need to declare the specific type of the variable when we initialize it . Because of this feature of Python, executing x = 21 will automatically turn this variable into an integer by default due to its value of 21. Likewise, executing x = 21.0 instead will make x the float type.","title":"1.1.3.1 Variable types"},{"location":"solutions/SOLN_S1_Python_and_Jupyter/#exercise-2-create-and-change-some-variables","text":"Start by initializing a variable named hundred and assign it an integer value of 100 in the code cell below.

Consider two variables, num1 = 5 and num2 = 5.0 . From what you learned in section 1.1.3, num1 represents an integer, while num2 represents a float. num1 = 5 num2 = 5.0 For this example, what happens when we add num1 and num2 together in Python, as in, run the code num1 + num2 ? type ( num1 + num2 ) float As you see from the output of that operation, the result is 10.0, which is a float. What this means is that for any operation that uses a float type in Python, the default type of the result will also be a float . In this example, mixing an integer ( num1 ) and float ( num2 ) together by addition resulted in 10.0 and not 10, even if the sum is a whole number. Although mixing the two data types did not cause a runtime error, you should recognize this behavior in the near future, when such computations result in output that you may not expect - and possibly lead you to some functionality that causes an error elsewhere. Finally, let's discuss a third variable, called num3 , and let's assign it a value of \"5\" . num3 = \"5\" type ( num3 ) str If we try adding num1 with num3 , or 5 + \"5\", what is our output now from the code num1 + num3 ? # num1 + num3 The output is neither a 10 or a 10.0 - instead, we receive a TypeError. Python does not allow you to perform mathematical operations with an integer and string together . Because num1 is an integer, and num3 is a string type - given the double quotes around 5 - adding the two together in Python results in this TypeError, even if the string represents a numeric character. The same goes for combining floats with strings: is our output from the code num2 (float) and num3 (string) any different? # num2 + num3 Nope! Same TypeError results here. One workaround/solution for this is converting ( type casting ) the num3 string variable into either a float or a integer, using Python's built-in float() and int() functions respectively. Let's try adding num1 and num3 again, only this time using int() to convert num3 into an integer type, running the full line of code as num1 + int(num3) . num3 '5' num1 + int ( num3 ) 10 int ( num3 ) 5 This time, we get no TypeError - the output is 10! Without diving too much further into the intricacies of these conversion functions - the concept of functions themselves will be covered in more detail in session 3! - just be aware that this example only works because the string represented by num3 was a valid convertible string (\"5\") to begin with. In other words, if num3 was \"Five\" instead of \"5\", we would not be able to execute int(num3) without getting an error. # num3 = \"Five\" # int(num3)","title":"1.1.4.2 Enrichment: The difference between 5, 5.0, and \"5\""},{"location":"solutions/SOLN_S1_Python_and_Jupyter/#115-code-comments-with","text":"Comments are notes in your code, and can serve many purposes, such as: - Describing the functionality of some code - A reminder to fix an existing issue - Clarify details of some code for yourself and/or others You can create a comment by using '#', and when the Python interpreter sees this syntax, it doesn't run that as code and recognizes it as a comment instead . For example, for a mathematical operation, let's add a comment at the end of the line to describe what this performs: 2 + 5 # Adds 2 to 5, so we get 7 7 In this case, the # Adds 2 to 5, so we get 7 part of the previous line of code was a comment appended to the end of the Python code, 2 + 5 . By adding that '#' character, Python knows everything after that character is a comment. Additionally, you can write comments on their own line(s) of code: # Adds 2 to 5, so we get 7 # Adds 2 to 5, so we get 7 # Adds 2 to 5, so we get 7 # # Adds 2 to 5, so we get 7 # Adds 2 to 5, so we get 7 # Adds 2 to 5, so we get 2 + 5 7 You may use this syntax for code that you may not want to execute, but still save for future reference or revision. To do this, you can simply add '#' at the very beginning of the line you wish to comment. In the following example, I've turned the first line of the code in this cell into a comment so it won't run: print ( \"I commented out this line of code so you won't see this statement printed\" ) print ( \"There should be one line printed from this cell, and should be this one.\" ) I commented out this line of code so you won't see this statement printed There should be one line printed from this cell, and should be this one. we can toggle comments with ctrl + /","title":"1.1.5 Code comments with '#'"},{"location":"solutions/SOLN_S1_Python_and_Jupyter/#exercise-5-add-a-comment-to-a-line-of-code","text":"Let's write a comment that explains the following line of code, 25 % 7 . 25 % 7 # returns the modulus of 25 and 7 4 Comments in your code are optional, but are recommended to help better inform readers of your code.

We will close with seeing conditional execution and functions. Hang on for the ride! Normally, a notebook begins with import statements that import packages or libraries that do a lot of heavy lifting for us. We'll get to that later. 2.0 A quick review from last session \u00b6 Recall, we discussed variables and comments . 2.0.1 A quick review of variables \u00b6 Variables are human names we give data objects in our code. Variables in Python should be named using appropriate descriptions of their purpose. By convention, most variable names are lower case and may optionally contain the underscore character (' _ '). So far, you've only seen examples of functions and variables in Python, but eventually you will encounter all the types of python objects in this table! Type Naming Convention Examples Function Use a lowercase word or words. Separate words by underscores to improve readability. function, my_function Variable Use a lowercase single letter, word, or words. Separate words with underscores to improve readability. x, var, my_variable Class Start each word with a capital letter. Do not separate words with underscores. This style is called camel case. Model, MyClass Method Use a lowercase word or words. Separate words with underscores to improve readability. class_method, method Constant Use an uppercase single letter, word or words. Separate words with underscores to improve readability. CONSTANT, MY_CONSTANT, MY_LONG_CONSTANT Module Use a short, lowercase word or words. Separate words with underscores to improve readability. module.py, my_module.py Package (a collection of Modules) Use a short, lowercase word or words. Do not separate words with underscores. package, mypackage Some names you might want to use are off-limits because they are reserved words , meaning they are words in Python that have special meaning. Examples of reserved words that you should not use as variable names are in the table below. The ones in bold are ones we will use in the session today. Remember, these can't be used as variable names! import True False if else def in not and or None from continue pass class await raise del lambda return elif with as finally nonlocal while assert except global yield break try global Let's see an example of a decimal point containing number, known to computers as a floating point number. Let's use \\(\\pi\\) as the number. (Pro tip: you can write equations in Markdown. See this reference .) pickles = 3.14 print(pickles) pickles = 3.14 print ( pickles ) 3.14 Cool. We defined a variable named pickles containing a poor estimate of \\(\\pi\\). Now every place the word pickles appears, it will have the value 3.14 , at least until we change it. \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 1: Picking variable names \u00b6 Is pickles a good variable name for the value \\(\\pi\\)? If not, what would be a better name? Is it in the reserved word list above? Use the code cell below to create a new variable with your preferred name in it. # Cell for Exercise 1 pie = 3.14 Variables in Python have different data types. The simple ones, we've already discussed such as an integer or int , a string or str , a decimal point containing number called a floating point number. Floating point numbers are special and are stored in a computer's memory using internal representations . One important thing to know about floating point numbers is that to a computer, the statement below may not always be true. For now, just think about floating point numbers as approximately representing the decimal number you see. 10.0 * 0.1 = 1.0 Variables can change their value in Python so we can change the value of pickles to something else. For example, a definition of what pickles are. pickles = \"A cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.\" print(pickles) pickles = \"A cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.\" print ( pickles ) A cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine. 2.0.2 A quick review of comments \u00b6 Just like we should use good naming conventions for variables so they make sense, we should have good comments to help readers follow our code. Good comments can turn a speck of coding gold into a valuable nugget of knowledge. Bad or wrong comments are bugs. If you want to learn more about why we call computer coding problems bugs, read about Grace Hopper and see her photo of a bug in her notebook . To comment out some text, use the # or hashtag or sometimes called the pound character. print(pickles) print ( pickles ) A cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine. # This is an example comment. Notice it is in english and full sentences. That is good style. # This is an example comment. Notice it is in english and full sentences. That is good style. 2.1 Data Structures: Variables that organize data \u00b6 Many variables you will encounter are more than the above simple data types (integers, strings, floating point numbers). In fact, they may contain a few to many pieces of data rolled into one thing or data structure . Next, we'll discuss two important data structures : lists and dictionaries . There are many advanced data structures in Python that behave like lists and dictionaries , in different settings but their concepts are often similar. Thus, understanding them here will help us understand more advanced concepts. Let's start with the venerable list . 2.1.1 Lists \u00b6 For more than just shopping. A list is an ordered collection of data. By collection , we mean that it contains multiple data. By ordered , we mean that the data are arranged so that they appear first to last like words in a sentence. The order is important for the meaning of the sentence. Let's begin by creating a list variable named my_list that contains three pieces of information. my_list = ['I', 'like', 'pie'] my_list my_list = [ 'I' , 'like' , 'pie' ] my_list ['I', 'like', 'pie'] Now the value of the variable my_list points to a list of three strings. The use of [ , ] , and , are used to denote the begining, end and separator of the list. Like a sentence, this list of words is ordered. I like pie. Notice, we didn't use a print() on the variable. The last variable expression in a cell is shown in the notebook by default. The elements in a list have indices. That is, to access an element in the list, you can refer to it by its index. Think of a list like a very simple table. index value 0 'I' 1 'like' 2 'pie' People might start counting at 1 , but computers start counting at 0 . The first element in a list has the index 0 , the last element in a list has the index of the length of the list minus 1. For our list which is three elements long, the first index will be 0 and the last index will be 2 . Some programming languages also start counting at 1. These include Fortran , Matlab , and the abominable R . This is unfortunate. Be extra careful if you try to port code from those languages to Python. If you want to access a list element you can use its index. The index value is designated by appending [ and ] to the variable name with the index between. Examples are always easier than words: my_list[0] Given what you know... What will this output? my_list [ 0 ] 'I' If you try to use an index that is larger than the length of the list minus 1, you will get an error. Try it! The different colors means you made a boo boo! my_list[3] # my_list[3] The last line of the error report is the most informative for us now. It should read: IndexError: list index out of range It is trying to tell you that an IndexError occured because the the index you tried to access is out of the range of 0 to 2 , inclusive. Translation: stay in your lane, programmer! In addition to being able to recall or access a value of a list by the element's index in the list, we can change the value of the element. We will also use the [ <index> ] notation but like when we set the value of a variable, we will use the = character. Let's do it! my_list[2] = 'cake' my_list # my_list[2] = 'cake' # my_list my_list [ 2 ] = 'cake' my_list ['I', 'like', 'cake'] 2.1.1.1 Append, and other list functions \u00b6 Finally, let's talk about empty lists and appending items to a list. An empty list is created by setting a variable to [] . This means the variable's data type is a list, but it contains no elements. a_new_list = [] a_new_list = [] a_new_list [] We can append items to a list by using the .append() function . We'll talk more about functions later, but when this function or method is used on a variable whose data type is list, it will append the value in between the () to the end of the list. a_new_list.append(\"1st element\") print(a_new_list) a_new_list.append(\"2nd element\") print(a_new_list) a_new_list . append ( \"1st element\" ) a_new_list ['1st element'] a_new_list = [] a_new_list . append ( \"1st element\" ) print ( a_new_list ) a_new_list . append ( \"2nd element\" ) print ( a_new_list ) ['1st element'] ['1st element', '2nd element'] Finally, in addition to the .append() function , there are a lot of functions (or methods ) available for lists . See a complete list of them here . One more we'll touch on quickly is the len() function . It returns the length of a list . Here is an example: len(a_new_list) Before you run this cell. What do you think it will output? len ( a_new_list ) 2 2.1.1.2 Slicing \u00b6 Sometimes you want to make a list from consecutive elements of a list. This is called slicing where you cut up a list and get just the consecutive values you want. Slicing is done with the : character in the index area between the [ and the ] . Here is an example to pull just the last two items out of my_list . We use the first index, then a : , then the last index plus 1. Like this: my_list[1:3] You might be asking... WHY +1?? This is because with slices or ranges in Python are known as half-open intervals where the lower bound is inclusive and the upper bound is the non-inclusive limit. TL;DR : add one to the upper end of a slice or a range in Python. my_list[1:3] my_list [ 1 : 3 ] ['like', 'cake'] Just for giggles, try it with my_list[1:2] . You will see the range of the slice is only 1 . That's because 2 - 1 = 1 . my_list[1:2] my_list [ 1 : 2 ] ['like'] You don't even need to use the upper bound if all you really mean is the end of the list . For that, you can leave the index empty. Hot dog! Let's see an example... my_list[1:] my_list [:] ['I', 'like', 'cake'] But wait, there's more! You can set multiple elements of a list at the same time by slicing . Dig this! my_list[1:] = ['love', 'puppies'] my_list my_list [ 1 :] ['like', 'cake'] my_list [ 1 :] = [ 'love' , 'puppies' ] my_list ['I', 'love', 'puppies'] And who doesn't love puppies? Recap... Lists are ordered collections of information that you can recognize by their use of [ and ] . To access or address elements in the list, you can use indices . They start at 0 in Python. The last element of a list has the index of the length of the list minus 1. When slicing a list, use two indices separated by : . If you leave one off, it means everything up to or beyond that element. \ud83d\ude4b Question 1: Slicing \u00b6 Will either one of the following codes will return an error? my_list[:len(my_list)] my_list[len(my_list)] my_list [: len ( my_list )] ['I', 'love', 'puppies'] longer_list = [ 'I' , 'like' , 'puppies' , 'and' , 'sand' , 'castles' ] number_list = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] # list[<start>:<end>:<step>] number_list [:: - 1 ] [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1] 2.1.1.3 Negative indices?!?! \u00b6 A brief note for folks who want to learn more. You can use negative index numbers to access from the end of the list towards the front. That is, a negative 1 ( -1 ) is the last element in the list. A negative 2 ( -2 ) is the second to last. The same rules apply for slicing with the : character. A quick demo example... Let's get last element in the list using negative indexing. That will be -1 . Here goes... my_list[-1] my_list [ - 1 ] 'puppies' We can also use slicing with negative indices . Remember, that slicing works the same way with negative indices , i.e. the the upper bound is non-inclusive. Here is an example using upper and lower bounds. Were you surprised by the results? my_list[-3:-1] longer_list ['I', 'like', 'puppies', 'and', 'sand', 'castles'] longer_list [ 5 :: - 1 ] ['castles', 'sand', 'and', 'puppies', 'like', 'I'] 2.1.1.4 Lists can contain most anything \u00b6 So far, we've seen a list containing some strings. That made our sentence analogy about the ordering of objects or strings in a list make sense. But lists can contain a mixture of data types and data structures . As a quick example, let's make a list that contains a integer, a string and a floating point number. This will be a four element list. zoo = [ 42, 'Elephants', 'ate', 3.14 ] zoo = [ 42 , 'Elephants' , 'ate' , 3.14 ] zoo [42, 'Elephants', 'ate', 3.14] We can even make a list of lists. META! list_of_lists = [ [ 42, 43, 44, 44 ], [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' ] ] list_of_lists[0] list_of_lists[0][1] a_list = list_of_lists[0] a_list[1] list_of_lists = [ [ 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 ], [ 'a' , 'b' , 'c' , 'd' ] ] The important thing here is to have the right number of [ and ] to embed a list in a list separated between , . Yeah, this is super meta. list_of_lists [ 0 ] [42, 43, 44, 45] list_of_lists [ 0 ][ 1 ] 43 list_of_lists [ 1 ][ 1 ] 'b' a_list = list_of_lists [ 0 ] a_list [ 1 ] 43 \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 2: accessing lists of lists \u00b6 Make sure you understand why the above works. Take a minute and play with the first and last indices. access 45 in list_of_lists access d in list_of_lists # Cell for exercise 2 print ( list_of_lists [ 0 ][ - 1 ]) print ( list_of_lists [ 1 ][ - 3 ]) 45 b list_of_lists [[42, 43, 44, 45], ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']] print ( list_of_lists [ - 2 ][ - 1 ]) print ( list_of_lists [ - 1 ][ - 3 ]) 45 b 2.1.2 Dictionaries \u00b6 For more than just reading on a Friday night. Sometimes we want to access elements in a data structure by something other than an index. Consider a dictionary on the internet . You look up the word on a seach engine and go to the web page of the entry for the word. Python has a similar concept where the index for an element in a collection is not a number, as it is in a list above, but a key that, may be a string like 'pickles' . 2.1.2.1 Key, value pairs \u00b6 In the case of a Python dictionary , we call the definition a value and the way we look up the definition is a key . This results in key and value pairs. One key maps to one value . In our analogy of a internet dictionary, this is the same as the word to definition pairs. Let's create a simple dictionary with a definition we have alread seen in the tutorials... Pickles. my_dict = {} # create an empty dictionary my_dict['pickles'] = \"A cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.\" my_dict my_dict = {} # create an empty dictionary my_dict [ 'pickles' ] = \"A cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.\" my_dict {'pickles': 'A cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.'} Notice the use of the # comment. Nice. Unlike the list, for dictionaries, some of their operations use the { and } brackets. Using a key to access or retrieve a value from the dictionary still uses the [ and ] brackets. Stick with it, for realz. Case matters in a dictionary because the key is a data type itself. my_dict['Pickles'] returns an error ( KeyError: 'Pickles' ) and the following does not my_dict['pickles'] # my_dict['Pickles'] This is a lot like the IndexError from the list case. Moving on... You can change the value of a dictionary key by reassigning it. For example below, we use the same key 'pickles' to change the definition of the word in our dictionary. Notice we still use the [ and ] brackets but we use the key instead of the index like we did with lists. The change we made in the string is that the cucumbers in pickles are usually small. my_dict['pickles'] = \"A small cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.\" my_dict [ 'pickles' ] = \"A small cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.\" my_dict {'pickles': 'A small cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.'} Let's add two key and value pairs to our dictionary which are in the table below: key value list An ordered collection. dictionary A collection with unique indices . Something like: my_dict['list'] = \"An ordered collection\" print(my_dict) Is probably where we want to begin. my_dict [ 'list' ] = \"An ordered collection\" my_dict {'list': 'An ordered collection', 'pickles': 'A small cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.'} # my_dict[0] Finally, like the list's .append() function , there are a lot of functions (or methods ) and attributes available for dictionaries. See a complete list of them here . (we will cover the difference between a method and an attribute more concretely later on...) 2.2 Flow control: If this, then that... \u00b6 Flow control is a fancy phrase meaning to execute some code statements under certain conditions. The simplest case, is an if statement (figure right below): If a variable is True then do something. If it is False then do something else, or do nothing at all. Flow control figure In the above figure: the selection refers to if statements Iteration refers to loops or repeating some statements over and over while changing a small number of variable values Sequence roughly corresponds to blocks of statements in functions . Flow control refers how to programs do loops, conditional execution, and order of functional operations. Let's start with conditionals, or the venerable if statement. 2.2.1 If \u00b6 Let's write a simple if statement if 5 == 5.0 : print ( True ) True Mathematically, the float 5.0 and integer 5, do evaluate to be the same! What do we notice about the second line? That's right, there's an indentation. Colab and most IDEs will automatically indent for you. Let's practice that below. 2.2.1.1 Indentations in python \u00b6 Exercise 3.1: Writing and if statement practice writing a simple if statement, notice the automatic indentation # cell for exercise 3.1 a = 2 b = 3 if b < a : print ( True ) 2.2.1.2 Conditional fall through and reserved words \u00b6 If statements can be used to execute some lines or block of code if a particular condition is satisfied. E.g. Let's print something based on the entries in the list. mission = [\"let's\", \"explore\", \"some\", \"data\", \"!\"] if '!' in mission: print('#notaword') mission = [ \"let's\" , \"explore\" , \"some\" , \"data\" , \"!\" ] if '!' in mission : print ( '#notaword' ) #notaword 2.2.1.2.1 in \u00b6 Notice the use the special reserved word in . This returns the value True when a value appears in a list and False when it does not. Notice how it reads like English. Readability is a key feature of Python and is part of the language design philosophy. Usually we want conditional logic on both sides of a binary condition, e.g. some action when True and some when False if '!' in mission: print(\"This isn't a full word!\") else: print(\"Nothing to see here\") if 4 in mission : print ( \"This isn't a full word!\" ) else : print ( \"Nothing to see here\" ) Nothing to see here 2.2.1.2.2 pass \u00b6 There is a special do nothing word: pass that skips over some arm of a conditional, e.g. if 'data' in mission: print(\"Congrats, you're working with data, it will be grand!\") else: pass unexpected = 0 if 4 in mission : print ( \"Congrats, you're working with data, it will be grand!\" ) else : unexpected += 1 pass The use of pass here is very important. While you can actually skip the else and pass statements and the code will behave identically, using them is an important signal that you intended for the negative case to do nothing. When you are writing code, you should start thinking about reading code and how others will read your code. In short, when you have one side of an if statement that has no code use an else and a pass to be a good citizen. Remember, the person you will collaborate the most about your code is yourself in 3-6 months. Love yourself, use pass . Note : what have you noticed in this session about quotes? What is the difference between ' and \" ? Another simple example: if True is False: print(\"I'm so confused\") else: print(\"Everything is right with the world\") if True is False : print ( \"I'm so confused\" ) else : print ( \"Everything is right with the world\" ) Everything is right with the world 2.2.1.2.3 if , elif , and else \u00b6 It is always good practice to handle all cases explicity. Conditional fall through is a common source of bugs. Sometimes we wish to test multiple conditions. Use if , elif , and else . my_favorite = 'pie' if my_favorite is 'cake': print(\"He likes cake! I'll start making a double chocolate velvet cake right now!\") elif my_favorite is 'pie': print(\"He likes pie! I'll start making a cherry pie right now!\") else: print(\"He likes \" + my_favorite + \". I don't know how to make that.\") my_favorite = 'pie' if my_favorite is 'cake' : print ( \"He likes cake! I'll start making a double chocolate velvet cake right now!\" ) elif my_favorite is 'pie' : print ( \"He likes pie! I'll start making a cherry pie right now!\" ) else : print ( \"He likes \" + my_favorite + \". I don't know how to make that.\" ) He likes pie! I'll start making a cherry pie right now! Note : There is a big difference between the above using elif and this code that uses sequential if s: if my_favorite is 'pie': print(\"He likes pie! I'll start making a double chocolate velvet pie right now!\") if my_favorite is 'pie': print(\"He still likes pie! I'll start making a cherry pie right now!\") else: print(\"He likes \" + my_favorite + \". I don't know how to make that.\") Before you run the cell, can you describe how these two blocks differ in their outcomes? a = 0 for i in range ( 10 ): a += 1 # a = a + 1 a 10 if my_favorite == 'pie' : print ( \"He likes pie! I'll start making a double chocolate velvet pie right now!\" ) if my_favorite is 'pie' : print ( \"He still likes pie! I'll start making a cherry pie right now!\" ) else : print ( \"He likes \" + my_favorite + \". I don't know how to make that.\" ) He likes pie! I'll start making a double chocolate velvet pie right now! He still likes pie! I'll start making a cherry pie right now! 2.2.1.2.4 and , or and not \u00b6 Conditionals can take and and or and not . E.g. my_favorite = 'pie' if my_favorite is 'cake' or my_favorite is 'pie': print(my_favorite + \" : I have a recipe for that!\") else: print(\"Ew! Who eats that?\") Side note: We haven't mentioned this up until now, in the following cell, we are composing a new string using + and feeding this into the print statement: my_favorite + \" : I have a recipe for that!\" my_favorite = 'pie' if ( my_favorite is 'cake' ) or ( my_favorite is 'pie' ): print ( my_favorite + \" : I have a recipe for that!\" ) else : print ( \"Ew! Who eats that?\" ) pie : I have a recipe for that! # and or # & | \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 3: Writing conditionals \u00b6 Write a series of two if statements, that both evaluate as true and print something Write an if followed by an elif statement, where only one evaluates as true and prints something # Cell for exercise 4 thing = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] if 1 in thing : print ( 1 ) if 4 in thing : print ( 4 ) print () if thing == [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ]: # will evaluate if the two objects are equal in value print ( 'equals evals as true' ) if thing is [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ]: # is will evaluate if we are in the same memory location print ( 'is evals as true' ) 1 4 equals evals as true 2.2.2 For \u00b6 For loops are the standard loop, though while is also common. For has the general form: for items in list: do stuff 2.2.2.1 Iterating through objects \u00b6 For loops and collections like tuples, lists and dictionaries are natural friends. The loop is iterating through an object we call an iterable . tuples, lists, and dictionaries, are all iterables mission for item in mission: print(item) mission [\"let's\", 'explore', 'some', 'data', '!'] for i in mission : print ( i ) let's explore some data ! Note that after the for loop has ended, the item variable remains defined and contains the last value of the list that was iterated over. %% timeit for i in range ( 10 ): pass The slowest run took 5.96 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached. 1000000 loops, best of 5: 410 ns per loop %% timeit i = 0 while i < 10 : i += 1 1000000 loops, best of 5: 677 ns per loop You can combine loops and conditionals: for item in mission: if item.endswith('!'): print(item + \" doesn't look like a whole word!\") else: print(item + \" is a word in a sentence!\") for item in mission : if item . endswith ( '!' ): print ( item + \" doesn't look like a whole word!\" ) else : print ( item + \" is a word in a sentence!\" ) let's is a word in a sentence! explore is a word in a sentence! some is a word in a sentence! data is a word in a sentence! ! doesn't look like a whole word! Dictionaries can use the keys method for iterating. my_dict.keys() for key in my_dict.keys(): if len(key) > 4: print(my_dict[key]) my_dict . keys () dict_keys(['pickles', 'list']) for key in my_dict . keys (): if len ( key ) > 4 : print ( my_dict [ key ]) A small cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine. Strings are basically a list. Therefore, you can use a for loop to iterate over the characters in a string. Note that c is a typical variable name for characters in a string. Generally, one letter variable names are not a good thing. my_string = \"caffeine\" for c in my_string: print(c) my_string = \"caffeine\" for c in my_string : print ( c ) c a f f e i n e 2.2.2.2 range() \u00b6 Manually constructing a list of sequential numbers is a total pain. A total pain. So Python has a function called range that simplifies the creation of lists that contain a sequence. Let's see it in action! Note that if we want a sequence from 0 to 2, inclusive, we call the range function with a argument of 3 . This is like the upper bound in slicing - it is always 1 plus the maximum value you want in the list. range(3) range ( 3 ) range(0, 3) list ( range ( 1 , 10 , 2 )) [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] Wait up, hoss. That result doesn't look like a list! True. However, it acts identically to a list, but works a little different under the hood to save memory. The equivalent hand made list would look like this: [0, 1, 2] [ 0 , 1 , 2 ] [0, 1, 2] 2.2.2.2.1 list , type cast function \u00b6 We can convert a range to a list by using the list type cast function . list(range(3)) list ( range ( 3 )) [0, 1, 2] Notice that Python (in the newest versions, e.g. 3+) has an object type that is a range. This saves memory and speeds up calculations vs. an explicit representation of a range as a list - but it can be automagically converted to a list on the fly by Python. To show the contents as a list we can use the type case like with the tuple above. Sometimes, in older Python docs, you will see xrange . This used the range object back in Python 2 and range returned an actual list. Beware of this! list ( range ( 3 )) [0, 1, 2] Remember earlier with slicing, the syntax :3 meant [0, 1, 2] ? Well, the same upper bound philosophy applies here. xs = [0, 1, 2] for x in xs[0:1]: if x < 2: print(x) else: pass xs = [ 0 , 1 , 2 ] for x in xs [ 0 : 3 ]: if x < 2 : print ( x ) else : pass 0 1 Let's use range to acccess our list, mission using list element indexing. for index in range(5): item = mission[index] if item.endswith('!'): print(item + \" doesn't look like a whole word!\") else: print(item + \" is a word in a sentence!\") for index in range ( 5 ): #0, 1, 2, 3, 4 item = mission [ index ] # the different items in the list mission if item . endswith ( '!' ): print ( item + \" doesn't look like a whole word!\" ) else : print ( item + \" is a word in a sentence!\" ) let's is a word in a sentence! explore is a word in a sentence! some is a word in a sentence! data is a word in a sentence! ! doesn't look like a whole word! This would probably be better written as below. Why is it better to use to use the len() function than hard code the length of the list? for index in range(len(mission)): item = mission[index] if item.endswith('!'): print(item + \" doesn't look like a whole word!\") else: print(item + \" is a word in a sentence!\") for index in range ( len ( mission )): item = mission [ index ] if item . endswith ( '!' ): print ( item + \" doesn't look like a whole word!\" ) else : print ( item + \" is a word in a sentence!\" ) let's is a word in a sentence! explore is a word in a sentence! some is a word in a sentence! data is a word in a sentence! ! doesn't look like a whole word! for item in mission [: 3 ]: if item . endswith ( '!' ): print ( item + \" doesn't look like a whole word!\" ) else : print ( item + \" is a word in a sentence!\" ) let's is a word in a sentence! explore is a word in a sentence! some is a word in a sentence! But in all, it isn't very Pythonesque to use indexes like that (unless you have another reason in the loop) and you would opt instead for the instructor in instructors form. More often, you are doing something with the numbers that requires them to be integers, e.g. math. sum = 0 for i in range ( 10 ): sum += i print ( sum ) 45 Before we leave the topic of range() , let's take a quick look at the documentation for it here . Notice, it has another calling semantic than the one have have been using. We have been using this version: range(stop) Where the list will end at stop minus 1. There is another way the range function can be called which is to give it an inclusive start and an exclusive stop : range(start, stop) This returns a list of number that go from start to stop minus 1. Let's look at a quick example: range(1, 9) range ( 1 , 9 ) range(1, 9) 2.2.2.3 Nested for loops \u00b6 You can put a for loop inside another for loop. This is called nesting . Think of it like the Matryoshka dolls . The example below has a nested loop that counts to four each time the outer loop counts up one. The print function shows the value of the outside loop iterator i and the inside loop iterator j and the product of the two values. Notice how the inside loop runs through 1 to 3 for each value of the outside loop. We use some string formatting for the print statement. These are called f-strings because there is an f before the string. Don't worry too much about the print function statement here as it isn't the point of this example. Advanced topic : for more on formatting strings, see here . for i in range(1, 4): for j in range(1, 4): print(f'{i} * {j} = {i * j}') for i in range ( 1 , 4 ): for j in range ( 1 , 4 ): print ( f ' { i } * { j } = { i * j } ' ) 1 * 1 = 1 1 * 2 = 2 1 * 3 = 3 2 * 1 = 2 2 * 2 = 4 2 * 3 = 6 3 * 1 = 3 3 * 2 = 6 3 * 3 = 9 2.2.2.4 Exiting for loops \u00b6 You can exit a for loop if a condition is met. We'll explore this with reserved words break and continue 2.2.2.4.1 break \u00b6 Sometimes, in a for loop, you experience a condition where you want to terminate any further iterations of the loop. The reserved word break will completely exit a for loop. In this example, we exit the for loop when the iteration variable i is equal to the integer 4. for i in range(10): if i == 4: break i for i in range ( 10 ): # creates a list that starts at 0 ends at 10 exclusive print ( i ) if i == 4 : break i 0 1 2 3 4 4 2.2.2.4 continue \u00b6 Sometimes, in a for loop, you want to skip certain elements. The continue statement will effectively skip any further statements for that element in a list. Below, we sum the numbers from 0 to 9 and skip the value 5 . sum = 0 for i in range(10): if i == 5: continue else: print(i) sum += i print(\"sum is \", sum) for i in range ( 6 ): if i == 3 : continue print ( i ) 0 1 2 4 5 2.2.3 while \u00b6 In contrast to a for loop, a while loop continues to execute while the initiating condition continues to evaluate as True. a = 0 while a < 10 : a += 5 print ( \"hello!\" ) # a hello! hello! You can also use break and continue in while loops while True : print ( \"hello!\" ) break hello! \ud83d\ude4b Question 2: While Loops \u00b6 What happens in this cell? a = 0 while a < 10: if a == 5: continue a += 5 print(\"hello!\") # a = 0 # while a < 10: # if a == 5: # continue # a += 5 # print(\"hello!\") # a 2.3 The Zen of Python \u00b6 Finally, let's use end with a philosophy of Python. This is a fun Easter Egg , to see it, import this : import this The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity. Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. Now is better than never. Although never is often better than *right* now. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! 2.4 References \u00b6 Some links to references from content in this notebook are consolidated here for easy access. Enjoy!

In fact, they may contain a few to many pieces of data rolled into one thing or data structure . Next, we'll discuss two important data structures : lists and dictionaries . There are many advanced data structures in Python that behave like lists and dictionaries , in different settings but their concepts are often similar. Thus, understanding them here will help us understand more advanced concepts. Let's start with the venerable list .","title":"2.1 Data Structures: Variables that organize data"},{"location":"solutions/SOLN_S2_Data_Structures_and_Flow/#211-lists","text":"For more than just shopping. A list is an ordered collection of data. By collection , we mean that it contains multiple data. By ordered , we mean that the data are arranged so that they appear first to last like words in a sentence. The order is important for the meaning of the sentence. Let's begin by creating a list variable named my_list that contains three pieces of information. my_list = ['I', 'like', 'pie'] my_list my_list = [ 'I' , 'like' , 'pie' ] my_list ['I', 'like', 'pie'] Now the value of the variable my_list points to a list of three strings. The use of [ , ] , and , are used to denote the begining, end and separator of the list. Like a sentence, this list of words is ordered. I like pie. Notice, we didn't use a print() on the variable. The last variable expression in a cell is shown in the notebook by default. The elements in a list have indices. That is, to access an element in the list, you can refer to it by its index. Think of a list like a very simple table. index value 0 'I' 1 'like' 2 'pie' People might start counting at 1 , but computers start counting at 0 . The first element in a list has the index 0 , the last element in a list has the index of the length of the list minus 1. For our list which is three elements long, the first index will be 0 and the last index will be 2 . Some programming languages also start counting at 1. These include Fortran , Matlab , and the abominable R . This is unfortunate. Be extra careful if you try to port code from those languages to Python. If you want to access a list element you can use its index. The index value is designated by appending [ and ] to the variable name with the index between. Examples are always easier than words: my_list[0] Given what you know... What will this output? my_list [ 0 ] 'I' If you try to use an index that is larger than the length of the list minus 1, you will get an error. Try it! The different colors means you made a boo boo! my_list[3] # my_list[3] The last line of the error report is the most informative for us now. It should read: IndexError: list index out of range It is trying to tell you that an IndexError occured because the the index you tried to access is out of the range of 0 to 2 , inclusive. Translation: stay in your lane, programmer! In addition to being able to recall or access a value of a list by the element's index in the list, we can change the value of the element. We will also use the [ <index> ] notation but like when we set the value of a variable, we will use the = character. Let's do it! my_list[2] = 'cake' my_list # my_list[2] = 'cake' # my_list my_list [ 2 ] = 'cake' my_list ['I', 'like', 'cake']","title":"2.1.1 Lists"},{"location":"solutions/SOLN_S2_Data_Structures_and_Flow/#2111-append-and-other-list-functions","text":"Finally, let's talk about empty lists and appending items to a list. An empty list is created by setting a variable to [] . This means the variable's data type is a list, but it contains no elements. a_new_list = [] a_new_list = [] a_new_list [] We can append items to a list by using the .append() function . We'll talk more about functions later, but when this function or method is used on a variable whose data type is list, it will append the value in between the () to the end of the list. a_new_list.append(\"1st element\") print(a_new_list) a_new_list.append(\"2nd element\") print(a_new_list) a_new_list . append ( \"1st element\" ) a_new_list ['1st element'] a_new_list = [] a_new_list . append ( \"1st element\" ) print ( a_new_list ) a_new_list . append ( \"2nd element\" ) print ( a_new_list ) ['1st element'] ['1st element', '2nd element'] Finally, in addition to the .append() function , there are a lot of functions (or methods ) available for lists . See a complete list of them here . One more we'll touch on quickly is the len() function . It returns the length of a list . Here is an example: len(a_new_list) Before you run this cell.

This is called slicing where you cut up a list and get just the consecutive values you want. Slicing is done with the : character in the index area between the [ and the ] . Here is an example to pull just the last two items out of my_list . We use the first index, then a : , then the last index plus 1. Like this: my_list[1:3] You might be asking... WHY +1?? This is because with slices or ranges in Python are known as half-open intervals where the lower bound is inclusive and the upper bound is the non-inclusive limit. TL;DR : add one to the upper end of a slice or a range in Python. my_list[1:3] my_list [ 1 : 3 ] ['like', 'cake'] Just for giggles, try it with my_list[1:2] . You will see the range of the slice is only 1 . That's because 2 - 1 = 1 . my_list[1:2] my_list [ 1 : 2 ] ['like'] You don't even need to use the upper bound if all you really mean is the end of the list . For that, you can leave the index empty. Hot dog! Let's see an example... my_list[1:] my_list [:] ['I', 'like', 'cake'] But wait, there's more! You can set multiple elements of a list at the same time by slicing . Dig this! my_list[1:] = ['love', 'puppies'] my_list my_list [ 1 :] ['like', 'cake'] my_list [ 1 :] = [ 'love' , 'puppies' ] my_list ['I', 'love', 'puppies'] And who doesn't love puppies? Recap... Lists are ordered collections of information that you can recognize by their use of [ and ] . To access or address elements in the list, you can use indices . They start at 0 in Python. The last element of a list has the index of the length of the list minus 1. When slicing a list, use two indices separated by : .

The same rules apply for slicing with the : character. A quick demo example... Let's get last element in the list using negative indexing. That will be -1 . Here goes... my_list[-1] my_list [ - 1 ] 'puppies' We can also use slicing with negative indices .

Pickles. my_dict = {} # create an empty dictionary my_dict['pickles'] = \"A cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.\" my_dict my_dict = {} # create an empty dictionary my_dict [ 'pickles' ] = \"A cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.\" my_dict {'pickles': 'A cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.'} Notice the use of the # comment. Nice. Unlike the list, for dictionaries, some of their operations use the { and } brackets. Using a key to access or retrieve a value from the dictionary still uses the [ and ] brackets. Stick with it, for realz. Case matters in a dictionary because the key is a data type itself. my_dict['Pickles'] returns an error ( KeyError: 'Pickles' ) and the following does not my_dict['pickles'] # my_dict['Pickles'] This is a lot like the IndexError from the list case. Moving on... You can change the value of a dictionary key by reassigning it. For example below, we use the same key 'pickles' to change the definition of the word in our dictionary. Notice we still use the [ and ] brackets but we use the key instead of the index like we did with lists. The change we made in the string is that the cucumbers in pickles are usually small. my_dict['pickles'] = \"A small cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.\" my_dict [ 'pickles' ] = \"A small cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.\" my_dict {'pickles': 'A small cucumber preserved in vinegar or brine.'} Let's add two key and value pairs to our dictionary which are in the table below: key value list An ordered collection. dictionary A collection with unique indices .

This saves memory and speeds up calculations vs. an explicit representation of a range as a list - but it can be automagically converted to a list on the fly by Python. To show the contents as a list we can use the type case like with the tuple above. Sometimes, in older Python docs, you will see xrange . This used the range object back in Python 2 and range returned an actual list. Beware of this! list ( range ( 3 )) [0, 1, 2] Remember earlier with slicing, the syntax :3 meant [0, 1, 2] ?

Notice, it has another calling semantic than the one have have been using. We have been using this version: range(stop) Where the list will end at stop minus 1. There is another way the range function can be called which is to give it an inclusive start and an exclusive stop : range(start, stop) This returns a list of number that go from start to stop minus 1.

We've seen them previously and used them, for example the .append() function for lists, or the even more general print() function. Here, we'll dig into how you can make your own functions to encapsulate code that you will reuse over and over. 3.0 Review from Session on Data Structures and Flow Control \u00b6 In our last session, we discussed lists , dictionaries , and flow control . Lists are ordered collections of data that can be used to hold multiple pieces of information while preserving their order. We use [ and ] to access elements by their indices which start with 0 . All things that operate on lists like slices use the concept of an inclusive lower bound and an exclusive upper bound. So, the following gets elements from the list my_list with index values of 0 , 1 , and 2 , but not 3 ! my_list[0:3] \ud83d\ude4b Question 1: Slicing \u00b6 What other way is there of writing the same statement using slicing ? Hint, think about leaving out one of the numbers in the slice! Dictionaries are named collections of data that can be used to hold multiple pieces of information as values that are addressed by keys resulting in a key to value data structure. They are accessed with [ and ] but intialized with { and } . E.g. my_dict = { 'cake' : 'Tasty!', 'toenails' : 'Gross!' } my_dict['cake'] Finally, we talked about flow control and using the concept of conditional execution to decide which code statements were executed. Remember this figure? Flow control figure What are the if statments? Where do for loops fit in? 3.1 Functions \u00b6 For loops let you repeat some code for every item in a list. Functions are similar in that they run the same lines of code and, frequently, for new values of some variable (we call these parameters ). They are different in that functions are not limited to looping over items. Functions are a critical part of writing easy to read, reusable code. Create a function like: def function_name (parameters): \"\"\" optional docstring \"\"\" function expressions return [variable] Here is a simple example. It prints a string that was passed in and returns nothing. def print_string(string): \"\"\"This prints out a string passed as the parameter.\"\"\" print(string) return def print_string ( string ): \"\"\"This prints out a string passed as the parameter\"\"\" print ( string ) return To call the function, use: print_string(\"GIX is awesome!\") Note: The function has to be defined before you can call it! print_string ( \"GIX is awesome!\" ) GIX is awesome! def dummy_function (): pass # could also have an empty return 3.1.1 Reserved words: def, return, and yield \u00b6 Notice the highlighted words in our function definition: def and return these are reserved words in python used to define functions. Every function definition requires these reserved words. yield is another reserved word that is similar to return but operates slightly differently. It is beyond the scope of what we are covering in this session. This tutorial from realpython has good information on the topic. # what is return doing in this function? def my_square ( a ): the_square = a ** 2 return the_square return is going to output whatever value(s) follow after the keyword return when we call upon our function a = 2 my_square ( a ) 4 I'm going to return two values... def my_square ( a ): return a ** 2 , a and we see how the output updates accordingly We can capture these values on the output with... square , new_a = my_square ( a ) print ( square , new_a ) 4 2 square 4 new_a 2 3.1.2 Global vs local variables and function parameters \u00b6 In a function, new variables that you create are not saved when the function returns - these are local variables. Variables defined outside of the function can be accessed but not changed - these are global variables. let's define the following function def my_little_func ( a ): b = 10 return a * b my_little_func ( 2 ) 20 if I run the following... # b Let's play with this a little further... ...now let's define b outside the function and call our function with a=5 # what happens here? b = 100 my_little_func ( 5 ) b 100 # I set b = 100 # my little func ran (where b=10 inside the funciton) # i outputed b (the global variable b) and it still have the value of 100 we see that b is still 100, instead of 10 as its defined within the function. This is because b inside of my_little_func is a local variable. it doesn't matter how I define b outside the function because within the function it is set locally. ... Let's do this A LITTLE MORE def my_new_func ( a ): print ( b ) return a * b now if I call on my new function, because b is not defined locally within the function, it takes on the global value. This is typically not happy-happy fun-fun behavior for us: we want to be explicit about how we define and use our variables (but there are some times when this is appropriate to do) b = 1e4 # side note, what did I do here???? # 1 * 10 ** 4 my_new_func ( a ) 10000.0 20000.0 b 10000.0 3.1.1.1 Function Parameters \u00b6 Parameters (or arguments) in Python are all passed by reference. This means that if you modify the parameters in the function, they are modified outside of the function (enrichment topic: there are exceptions, see below). See the following example: def change_list(my_list): \"\"\"This changes a passed list into this function\"\"\" my_list.append('four'); print('list inside the function: ', my_list) return my_list = [1, 2, 3]; print('list before the function: ', my_list) change_list(my_list); print('list after the function: ', my_list) def change_list ( my_list ): \"\"\"This changes a passed list into this function\"\"\" my_list . append ( 'four' ); print ( 'list inside the function: ' , my_list ) return my_list = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] print ( 'list before the function: ' , my_list ) change_list ( my_list ) print ( 'list after the function: ' , my_list ) list before the function: [1, 2, 3] list inside the function: [1, 2, 3, 'four'] list after the function: [1, 2, 3, 'four'] \ud83c\udf52 3.1.1.2 Enrichment: Global, local, and immutables \u00b6 Let's go back to our former example... Keep in mind the following immutables: integers, float, str, tuples and now one-by-one uncomment lines 2-5; what is happening here!? b = \"a string\" # b = 10 # b = 10.2 # b = (10, 2) # b = [10, 2] def my_little_func ( b ): if type ( b ) == str : b += \"20\" elif ( type ( b ) == int ) or ( type ( b ) == float ): b += 10 elif ( type ( b ) == tuple ): print ( \"AYYY no tuple changes, Dude\" ) pass elif ( type ( b ) == list ): b . append ( 'whoaaaa' ) print ( b ) return print ( b ) my_little_func ( b ) print ( b ) [10, 2] [10, 2, 'whoaaaa'] [10, 2, 'whoaaaa'] There is a way to change a global variable within a function with the global keyword. Generally, the use of global variables is not encouraged, instead use parameters. We won't cover the global keyword here but you can explore further on your own if you are interested. \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 1: My first function \u00b6 Write a function that takes one parameter and returns any data structure If you are going to return multiple objects, what data structure that we talked about can be used? Give an example below. # Cell for excerise 1 def find_max ( a_list ): ans = 0 for i in a_list : if i > ans : ans = i return ans a_list = [ 100 , 1e4 , 55 , - 100 , 1e10 ] find_max ( a_list ) 10000000000.0 3.1.3 Parameter types \u00b6 We will now discuss the different parameter types. Function calling: In function calling we have positional and keyword parameters positional func(10, 20) keyword func(a=10, b=20) or func(b=20, a=10) Function writing: In funciton writing we can specify default values for parameters default def func(a=10, b=20) def print_name(first, last='Beckner'): print(f'Your name is {first} {last}') return def print_name ( first , last = 'Beckner' ): print ( \"Your name is {} {} \" . format ( first , last )) return print_name ( 'Beckner' , 'Wesley' ) Your name is Beckner Wesley Play around with the above function. print_name ( 'Wesley' , last = 'the Python Foundations Instructor' ) Your name is Wesley the Python Foundations Instructor Functions can contain any code that you put anywhere else including: * if ... elif ... else * for ... while * other function calls def print_name_age(first, last, age): print_name(first, last) print('Your age is %d' % (age)) if age > 25 and age < 40: print('You are a millenial!') return def print_name_age ( first , last , age ): print_name ( first , last ) print ( 'Your age is %d ' % ( age )) if age > 25 and age < 40 : print ( 'You are a millenial!' ) return print_name_age(age=29, last='Beckner', first='Wesley') print_name_age ( age = 29 , last = 'Beckner' , first = 'Wesley' ) Your name is Wesley Beckner Your age is 29 You are a millenial! def thing (): for i in range ( 10 ): pass return 3.2 The scientific python stack \u00b6 In addition to Python's built-in modules like the math module we explored previously, there are also many often-used third-party modules that are core tools for doing data science with Python. Some of the most important ones are: numpy : Numerical Python \u00b6 Numpy is short for \"Numerical Python\", and contains tools for efficient manipulation of arrays of data. If you have used other computational tools like IDL or MatLab, Numpy should feel very familiar. scipy : Scientific Python \u00b6 Scipy is short for \"Scientific Python\", and contains a wide range of functionality for accomplishing common scientific tasks, such as optimization/minimization, numerical integration, interpolation, and much more. We will not look closely at Scipy today, but we will use its functionality later in the course. pandas : Labeled Data Manipulation in Python \u00b6 Pandas is short for \"Panel Data\", and contains tools for doing more advanced manipulation of labeled data in Python, in particular with a columnar data structure called a Data Frame . If you've used the R statistical language (and in particular the so-called \"Hadley Stack\"), much of the functionality in Pandas should feel very familiar. matplotlib : Visualization in Python \u00b6 Matplotlib started out as a Matlab plotting clone in Python, and has grown from there in the 15 years since its creation. It is the most popular data visualization tool currently in the Python data world (though other recent packages are starting to encroach on its monopoly). scikit-learn : Machine Learning in Python \u00b6 Scikit-learn is a machine learning library. It features various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms, including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means, and DBSCAN. The library is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy. 3.3 Debugging \u00b6 On to Debugging! It\u2019s always important to check that our code is \u201cplugged in\u201d, i.e., that we\u2019re actually exercising the problem that we think we are. Every programmer has spent hours chasing a bug, only to realize that they were actually calling their code on the wrong dataset or with the wrong configuration parameters, or are using the wrong version of the software entirely. Mistakes like these are particularly likely to happen when we\u2019re tired, frustrated, and up against a deadline, which is one of the reasons late-night (or overnight) coding sessions are almost never worthwhile. - swcarpentry We'll now dedicate some discussion and practice to debugging in python. This easy to overlook topic can save us oodles of time down the road. It's worth the investment. Borrowing from software carpentry, we'll highlight the key guidlines to debugging code: Know what it's supposed to do Make it fail every time Make it fail fast Change one thing at a time, for a reason Keep track of what you've done Be humble 3.3.0 Before We Get Started \u00b6 We will refer to writing tests, and specifically writing unit tests in this module. Don't worry too much about the specifics of unit tests for now. We will have a dedicated module for that. What we do need to talk about is a specific built in function in python called the assert function 3.3.0.1 the assert function \u00b6 Let's take a simple example of the assert function. If I wanted to test that the sum of two numbers is correct I would write: assert sum ([ 2 , 5 ]) == 7 , \"should be 7\" Nothing is sent to the print out because the condition is satisfied. If we run, however: assert sum([2, 4]) == 7, \"should be 7\" we get an error message: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- AssertionError Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-3-d5724b127818> in <module>() ----> 1 assert sum([2, 4]) == 7, \"should be 7\" AssertionError: should be 7 Now to make this a test, you will want to wrap it in a function def test_sum (): assert sum ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) == 6 , \"Should be 6\" test_sum () print ( \"Everything passed\" ) Everything passed And if we include a test that does not pass: def test_sum(): assert sum([3, 3]) == 6, \"Should be 6\" def test_my_broken_func(): assert sum([1, 2]) == 5, \"Should be 5\" test_sum() test_my_broken_func() print(\"Everything passed\") Here our test fails, because the sum of 1 and 2 is 3 and not 5. We get a traceback that tells us the source of the error: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- AssertionError Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-13-8a552fbf52bd> in <module>() 6 7 test_sum() ----> 8 test_my_broken_func() 9 print(\"Everything passed\") <ipython-input-13-8a552fbf52bd> in test_my_broken_func() 3 4 def test_my_broken_func(): ----> 5 assert sum([1, 2]) == 5, \"Should be 5\" 6 7 test_sum() AssertionError: Should be 5 We will worry about the intricacies of what to test and when to test it at a later time. For now, we just need to understand the assert function so we can practice debugging and writing short tests for the problems that we fix today! Ok LETS GO 3.3.1 Know what it's supposed to do \u00b6 This may seem obvious, but it's easy to recognize that an error is happening without knowing what the correct answer is. This makes unit tests especially handy, they force us to know the expected outcome at least for intended use cases. Here are some tips in regard to knowing the expected outcome: test with simplified data test a simplified case compare to a base model visualize 3.3.2 Make it fail every time \u00b6 It can be extraordinarily difficult to debug code that is precidated on some stochastic process. remove stochasticity when possible . For instance, seed your random value generators ( random.seed() , np.random.seed() ) 3.3.3 Make it fail fast \u00b6 a corrolary to this, is narrow down the source of the error, and again this is why we write unit tests before integration tests. If it takes 20 minutes to train your neural network, and the error occurs during some post processing plotting of your loss history, obviously don't retrain the NN each time you iterate over the failure. Along the same lines, if you're debugging something in a for loop, run the loop once, or run the indented code outside of the loop with a placeholder for the iterated variable, in order to test and debug the code. 3.3.4 Change one thing at a time, for a reason \u00b6 Not much nuance here. Just like it's a good idea for us to change one aspect of our machine learning models and track the performance rather than to change multiple things at once, it's better to change one feature when debugging at a time.

You can think of these as charateristics that describe the object. class MyClass : pass # define a class class MyClass : some_attribute = 5 Defining a class in the above way, creates a blueprint . We use the class blueprint MyClass to create an instance . And after we do so, we can now access attributes belonging to that class: myname = MyClass () myname . some_attribute 5 # create instance instance = MyClass () # access attributes of the instance of MyClass instance . some_attribute 5 attributes can be changed: instance . some_attribute = 50 instance . some_attribute 50 instance . some_attribute = 'new datatype' instance . some_attribute 'new datatype' In practice we always use the __init__() function, which is executed when the class is being initiated. This is the pythonic way to be explicit about initializing the attributes of our class Upon investigation, you will find that the trouble with not using the __init__() method is that your attributes are not guaranteed to be initialized upon creation of the object from the class blueprint # define a class class MyClass : # we define our __init__ method that is called when the object is initialized def __init__ ( self ): # we pass in the reserved word self # we reference the current object of the class via the self parameter # and set its attributes self . some_attribute = 5 class MyClass : def __init__ ( self ): self . some_attribute = 5 MyClass () <__main__.MyClass at 0x7fbf14f80e10> instance = MyClass () instance . some_attribute 5 When we use __init__ , we also have to make use of a special reserved word in python: self . The self parameter refers to the current instance of the class. In other words, when the object is declared, it will refer to that specific object in memory and not all instances of the class in question. This is yet another pythonic way of being explicit. what is the special keyword self doing, do we really need it? Read more about the philosophy of the self by visiting the link! Let's practice class declaration now, in the context of Pokeballs We have a lot of different kinds of Poke balls! This is going to help us understand some of the powerful mechanisms inherit in python classes! Let's start by defining a class to describe the simple, standard Poke ball. It will have the following attributes: contains the name of the pokemon contained in the Poke ball. Default value is None type_name the type of Poke ball. Default value is \"Poke ball\" catch_rate the probability of a successful catch upon throwing the Poke ball. The default value is 0.5 and the user will not be able to set the value of this object. Let's take a look at how we do this: def Pokeball ( contains = None , type_name = \"Poke ball\" ): pass # define the class in the standard way via the reserved word class class Pokeball : # define the init method pass in the \"self\" and any attributes that will # be definable upon initialization of the object def __init__ ( self , contains = None , type_name = \"Poke ball\" ): # now set the attributes of the object via the self self . contains = contains self . type_name = type_name self . catch_rate = 0.50 # note this attribute is not accessible upon init # empty Poke ball pokeball1 = Pokeball () poke = Pokeball ( type_name = \"Master ball\" ) poke . type_name 'Master ball' # used Poke ball of a different type pokeball1 = Pokeball ( \"Pikachu\" , \"Master ball\" ) pokeball1 . contains 'Pikachu' \ud83d\ude4b Question 1 \u00b6 Note that, were we to run the following cell, we would get an error.

It will have a random chance of success and, additionally, it will only work if the Poke ball is empty. import random random . random () 0.9519142498637592 import random class Pokeball : def __init__ ( self , contains = None , type_name = \"Poke ball\" ): self . contains = contains self . type_name = type_name self . catch_rate = 0.50 # note this attribute is not accessible upon init # the method catch, will update self.contains, if a catch is successful # it will also use self.catch_rate to set the performance of the catch def catch ( self , pokemon ): if self . contains == None : if random . random () < self . catch_rate : self . contains = pokemon print ( f \" { pokemon } captured!\" ) else : print ( f \" { pokemon } escaped!\" ) else : print ( \"Poke ball is not empty!\" ) We can envoke the catch method the same way we would return the attribute of an object - by running <object>.method() .

We inherit a parent class by passing it into the child class: # Pokeball is the parent class and Masterball is the child class class Masterball ( Pokeball ): pass Once we declare an object of the child class.

You can think of these as charateristics that describe the object. class MyClass : pass # define a class class MyClass : some_attribute = 5 Defining a class in the above way, creates a blueprint . We use the class blueprint MyClass to create an instance . And after we do so, we can now access attributes belonging to that class: myname = MyClass () myname . some_attribute 5 # create instance instance = MyClass () # access attributes of the instance of MyClass instance . some_attribute 5 attributes can be changed: instance . some_attribute = 50 instance . some_attribute 50 instance . some_attribute = 'new datatype' instance . some_attribute 'new datatype' In practice we always use the __init__() function, which is executed when the class is being initiated. This is the pythonic way to be explicit about initializing the attributes of our class Upon investigation, you will find that the trouble with not using the __init__() method is that your attributes are not guaranteed to be initialized upon creation of the object from the class blueprint # define a class class MyClass : # we define our __init__ method that is called when the object is initialized def __init__ ( self ): # we pass in the reserved word self # we reference the current object of the class via the self parameter # and set its attributes self . some_attribute = 5 class MyClass : def __init__ ( self ): self . some_attribute = 5 MyClass () <__main__.MyClass at 0x7fbf14f80e10> instance = MyClass () instance . some_attribute 5 When we use __init__ , we also have to make use of a special reserved word in python: self . The self parameter refers to the current instance of the class. In other words, when the object is declared, it will refer to that specific object in memory and not all instances of the class in question. This is yet another pythonic way of being explicit. what is the special keyword self doing, do we really need it? Read more about the philosophy of the self by visiting the link! Let's practice class declaration now, in the context of Pokeballs We have a lot of different kinds of Poke balls! This is going to help us understand some of the powerful mechanisms inherit in python classes! Let's start by defining a class to describe the simple, standard Poke ball. It will have the following attributes: contains the name of the pokemon contained in the Poke ball. Default value is None type_name the type of Poke ball. Default value is \"Poke ball\" catch_rate the probability of a successful catch upon throwing the Poke ball. The default value is 0.5 and the user will not be able to set the value of this object. Let's take a look at how we do this: def Pokeball ( contains = None , type_name = \"Poke ball\" ): pass # define the class in the standard way via the reserved word class class Pokeball : # define the init method pass in the \"self\" and any attributes that will # be definable upon initialization of the object def __init__ ( self , contains = None , type_name = \"Poke ball\" ): # now set the attributes of the object via the self self . contains = contains self . type_name = type_name self . catch_rate = 0.50 # note this attribute is not accessible upon init # empty Poke ball pokeball1 = Pokeball () poke = Pokeball ( type_name = \"Master ball\" ) poke . type_name 'Master ball' # used Poke ball of a different type pokeball1 = Pokeball ( \"Pikachu\" , \"Master ball\" ) pokeball1 . contains 'Pikachu'","title":"4.1.1 Classes, Instances, Methods, and Attribtues"},{"location":"solutions/SOLN_S4_Object_Oriented_Programming/#question-1","text":"Note that, were we to run the following cell, we would get an error.

Here we'll look at value counts and the basics of group-by operations. # a basic select, filter, operate procedure would look like: df [ df [ 'country' ] == 'USA' ][ 'duration' ] . describe () count 28511.000000 mean 93.050437 std 18.576873 min 42.000000 25% 84.000000 50% 91.000000 75% 100.000000 max 398.000000 Name: duration, dtype: float64 we can invert the filter with ~ df [ ~ ( df [ 'country' ] == 'USA' )][ 'duration' ] . describe () count 57344.000000 mean 103.981410 std 23.459158 min 41.000000 25% 90.000000 50% 99.000000 75% 112.000000 max 808.000000 Name: duration, dtype: float64 In preparation for grouping the data, let's bin the instances by their duration (we could have chosen any numerical column). For that, we'll use pd.cut . The documentation for pd.cut can be found here . It is used to bin values into discrete intervals. This is like a histogram where for each bin along the range of data values, you count the number of occurrences of that bin. in our example, we'll use 10 bins and let Pandas decide how to evenly divide the range into the bins. Let's see it in action. df['duration_group'] = pd.cut(df['duration'], 10) df.head() df.dtypes df [ 'duration_group' ] = pd . cut ( df [ 'duration' ], 10 ) df . head () .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } imdb_title_id title original_title year date_published genre duration country language director writer production_company actors description avg_vote votes budget usa_gross_income worlwide_gross_income metascore reviews_from_users reviews_from_critics duration (hours) duration_group 0 tt0000009 Miss Jerry Miss Jerry 1894 1894-10-09 Romance 45 USA None Alexander Black Alexander Black Alexander Black Photoplays Blanche Bayliss, William Courtenay, Chauncey D...

We can use it, for example, to break down the movies by their duration group that we just created: pd.value_counts(df['duration_group'], sort=False) pd . value_counts ( df [ 'duration_group' ], sort = True ) (40.233, 117.7] 72368 (117.7, 194.4] 13197 (194.4, 271.1] 228 (271.1, 347.8] 40 (347.8, 424.5] 11 (501.2, 577.9] 4 (424.5, 501.2] 4 (731.3, 808.0] 1 (654.6, 731.3] 1 (577.9, 654.6] 1 Name: duration_group, dtype: int64 What happens if we try this on a continuous valued variable? pd.value_counts(df['duration']) pd . value_counts ( df [ 'duration' ]) 90 5162 95 3194 100 3106 92 2418 93 2414 ... 279 1 301 1 345 1 729 1 319 1 Name: duration, Length: 266, dtype: int64 \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 6: value_counts, unique, nunique \u00b6 We can do a little data exploration with this by seeing how common different values are. Play around with these pandas methods: value_counts() unique() nunique() Also be sure to use: selection filteration (and you are already using operation with the above mentioned pandas methods, value_counts, unique, nunique (: ) Do so with 3 different columns in the dataframe # Cell for Exercise 6 df [ 'director' ] . nunique () # i want ot filter for USA movies, select the directors, and # tell me the unique directors df . loc [ df [ 'country' ] == 'USA' ][ 'director' ] . nunique () 12463 5.1.4.4 Group-by Operation \u00b6 One of the killer features of the Pandas dataframe is the ability to do group-by operations. You can visualize the group-by like this (image borrowed from the Python Data Science Handbook ) 5.1.4.5 Summary statistics with groupby: value_counts , count , describe \u00b6 Let's break take this in smaller steps. Recall our duration_group column. pd.value_counts(df['duration_group']) pd . value_counts ( df [ 'duration_group' ]) (40.233, 117.7] 72368 (117.7, 194.4] 13197 (194.4, 271.1] 228 (271.1, 347.8] 40 (347.8, 424.5] 11 (501.2, 577.9] 4 (424.5, 501.2] 4 (731.3, 808.0] 1 (654.6, 731.3] 1 (577.9, 654.6] 1 Name: duration_group, dtype: int64 groupby allows us to look at the number of values for each column and each value. The group by documentation is here . Basically, groupby allows us to create groups of records based on their values. Let's count how many records, or rows, in our data set fall into each bin of our duration data. df.groupby(['duration_group']).count() df . groupby ([ 'duration_group' ]) . count () .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } imdb_title_id title original_title year date_published genre duration country language director writer production_company actors description avg_vote votes budget usa_gross_income worlwide_gross_income metascore reviews_from_users reviews_from_critics duration (hours) duration_group (40.233, 117.7] 72368 72368 72368 72368 72368 72368 72368 72315 71618 72309 71474 68922 72304 70464 72368 72368 19493 12123 24645 10759 65972 63321 72368 (117.7, 194.4] 13197 13197 13197 13197 13197 13197 13197 13186 13122 13171 12528 12211 13192 12990 13197 13197 4133 3153 6298 2506 12017 10493 13197 (194.4, 271.1] 228 228 228 228 228 228 228 228 221 226 221 207 228 226 228 228 70 40 59 28 215 188 228 (271.1, 347.8] 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 39 39 40 38 40 40 10 5 9 8 37 37 40 (347.8, 424.5] 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 10 11 11 10 11 11 11 11 1 3 3 1 9 10 11 (424.5, 501.2] 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 1 0 0 1 4 4 4 (501.2, 577.9] 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 1 0 0 0 2 3 4 (577.9, 654.6] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 (654.6, 731.3] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 (731.3, 808.0] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 Now, let's find the mean of each of the columns for each duration_group .

This is like a histogram where for each bin along the range of data values, you count the number of occurrences of that bin. in our example, we'll use 10 bins and let Pandas decide how to evenly divide the range into the bins.

And, more specifically, how we can manipulate our pandas dataframes to give us the visualizations we desire. Before we get there, however, we're going to start by introducing a python module called Matplotlib. 6.1 Visualization with Matplotlib \u00b6 Lets start by importing our matplotlib module. Pyplot is a module of Matplotlib that provides functions to add plot elements like text, lines, and images. Typically we import this module like so import matplotlib.pyplot as plt where plt is shorthand for the matplotlib.pyplot library import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 6.1.1 The Basics \u00b6 Matplotlib is strongly object oriented and its principal objects are the figure and the axes . But before we get into that I want us to explore the most basic use case. In this basic use case, we don't declare the figure and axes objects explicitly, but rather work directly in the pyplot namespace. I'l demonstrate to show what I mean here. I'm going to create a list of x and y values and plot them with pyplot x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] y = [1,1,2,3,5,8,13] plt.plot(x,y) x = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] y = [ 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 ] plt . plot ( x , y ) [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7fb4a1d75ed0>] We can label the axes of our figure using the xlabel and ylabel attributes, and label our title using the title attribute. plt.plot([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[1,1,2,3,5,8,13]) plt.title('The Fibonacci Sequence') plt.xlabel('Order in Sequence') plt.ylabel('Value') plt . plot ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ],[ 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 ]) plt . title ( 'The Fibonacci Sequence' ) plt . xlabel ( 'Order in Sequence' ) plt . ylabel ( 'Value' ) Text(0, 0.5, 'Value') \ud83d\ude4b Question 1 \u00b6 What do we think about the out-of-the-box formatting of pyplot ? What are some things we can do to make it better? Could we make it bigger? Perhaps different dimensions? Does anyone recognize that default line color? Before we make any changes, let's become acquianted with the more appropriate way to work in matplotlib.pyplot . In this formality, we explicitly create our figure and axes objects. # This is one way to do it... # plt.plot([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[1,1,2,3,5,8,13]) # but we can also do it this way, concretely declaring the figure, axes # objects directly # We declare the figure fig = plt.figure() # and then add axes ax = fig.add_subplot(111) You can think of the figure as a canvas, where you specify dimensions and possibly unifying attributes of its contents, like, background color, border, etc. You use the canvas, the figure , to containerize your other objects, primarily your axes , and to save its contents with savefig . You can think of an axes as the actual graphs or plots themselves. And when we declare these objects, we have access to all the methods of matplotlib.pyplot (e.g. .plot , .scatter , .hist etc.) You can place many of these axes into the figure container in a variety of ways. The last component of a pyplot figure are the axis , the graphical axis we typically think of. # This is one way to do it... # plt.plot([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[1,1,2,3,5,8,13]) # but we can also do it this way, concretely declaring the figure, axes # objects directly # We declare the figure fig = plt . figure () # and then add axes ax = fig . add_subplot ( 111 ) # number of rows, number of columns, # from left to right and top to bottom the individual axes that # this add_subplot call is creating plt.subplots returns a figure and axes object(s) together: ### We can also do it in 1 line fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(8,8)) and we'll go ahead and adjust the figure size with the parameter figsize and set it equal to a tuple containing the x and y dimensions of the figure in inches. ### We can also do it in 1 line fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 ) To recap, by convention we typically separate our plots into three components: a Figure, its Axes, and their Axis: Figure : It is a whole figure which may contain one or more than one axes (plots). You can think of a figure as a canvas which contains plots. Axes : It is what we generally think of as a plot. A figure can contain many axes . It contains two or three (in the case of 3D) axis objects. Each axes has a title, an x-label and a y-label. Axis : They are the traditional axis we think of in a graph and take care of generating the graph limits. Example: fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(8,8)) is creating the figure ( fig ) and axes ( ax ) explicitly, and depending on whether we create 2D or 3D plots, the axes will contain 2-3 axis . \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 1: Adjust Figure Size \u00b6 create a figure and axes using plt.subplots() . adjust the figure size to be 6 inches (width) by 3 inches (height).

We're now going to use that same approach but this time, the second variable that is returned (what we call ax in the cell bellow) is no longer an axes object! Instead, it is an array of axes objects. I'm also going to introduce another module, random , to generate some random values import random fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(10,10)) ax[0,1].plot(range(10), [random.random() for i in range(10)], c='tab:orange') ax[1,0].plot(range(10), [random.random() for i in range(10)], c='tab:green') ax[1,1].plot(range(10), [random.random() for i in range(10)], c='tab:red') ax[0,0].plot(range(10), [random.random() for i in range(10)], c='tab:blue') quick note: In the above cell we use something called list comprehension to quickly populate a list of objects (in this case those objects are floats). We won't dive too deeply into that now, but you can think of list comprehension as a more concise way of writing a for() loop. In future cases where list comprehension appears in this notebook I will include code snipets of the corresponding for loop. import random # this list comprehension print([random.random() for i in range(10)]) # produces the same output as this for loop ls = [] for i in range(10): ls.append(random.random()) print(ls) import random random . seed ( 42 ) # this list comprehension print ([ random . random () for i in range ( 10 )]) random . seed ( 42 ) # produces the same output as this for loop ls = [] for i in range ( 10 ): ls . append ( random . random ()) print ( ls ) [0.6394267984578837, 0.025010755222666936, 0.27502931836911926, 0.22321073814882275, 0.7364712141640124, 0.6766994874229113, 0.8921795677048454, 0.08693883262941615, 0.4219218196852704, 0.029797219438070344] [0.6394267984578837, 0.025010755222666936, 0.27502931836911926, 0.22321073814882275, 0.7364712141640124, 0.6766994874229113, 0.8921795677048454, 0.08693883262941615, 0.4219218196852704, 0.029797219438070344] The second thing we'll need to talk about is the grid of the ax object fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 2 , 2 ) ax . shape (2, 2) ax array([[<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x7fb4968ea3d0>, <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x7fb497187b50>], [<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x7fb496b3b190>, <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x7fb496b9ee10>]], dtype=object) This is exactly like accessing a matrix: matrix[row,column] = element we have the pandas equivalent: df.iloc[0,1] = element import random random . seed ( 12 ) fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 2 , 2 , figsize = ( 10 , 10 )) ax [ 0 , 0 ] . plot ( range ( 10 ), [ random . random () for i in range ( 10 )], c = 'tab:blue' ) ax [ 0 , 1 ] . plot ( range ( 10 ), [ random . random () for i in range ( 10 )], c = 'tab:orange' ) ax [ 1 , 0 ] . plot ( range ( 10 ), [ random . random () for i in range ( 10 )], c = 'tab:green' ) ax [ 1 , 1 ] . plot ( range ( 10 ), [ random . random () for i in range ( 10 )], c = 'tab:red' ) [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7fb4964a5a10>] \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 3: Subplots \u00b6 Create a 2x1 figure where the first axes is a plot of the fibonacci sequence up to the 10th sequence value and the second axes is a plot of 10 random integers with values between 10 and 20 (exclusive).

While the objectives of the exercizes may be to make certain visualizations, throughout our experience we'll be using pandas tricks to create the data splices we need, so in the following is a mix of new plotting stuff, with pandas data selection/splicing stuff. We're also going to import a new module called seaborn . It is another plotting library based off matplotlib . We're going to use it to pull some stylistic features. import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns from sklearn.datasets import load_boston import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns from ipywidgets import interact The following few cells should look familiar from last tutorial session, we're going to use some essential pandas methods to get a general sense of what our dataset looks like There are many ways to construct a dataframe, as an exercise, you might think of otherways to perform that task here. df = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wesleybeckner/ds_for_engineers/main/data/wine_quality/winequalityN.csv\") df.describe() # In your subsequent time with pandas you'll discover that there are a host of # ways to populate a dataframe. In the following, I can create a dataframe # simply by using read_csv because the data is formated in a way that # pandas can easily intuit. df = pd . read_csv ( \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wesleybeckner/\" \\ \"technology_explorers/main/assets/imdb_movies.csv\" ) /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py:2882: DtypeWarning: Columns (3) have mixed types.Specify dtype option on import or set low_memory=False. exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns) # we check the shape of our data to see if its as we expect df . shape (85855, 22) # we check the column names df . columns Index(['imdb_title_id', 'title', 'original_title', 'year', 'date_published', 'genre', 'duration', 'country', 'language', 'director', 'writer', 'production_company', 'actors', 'description', 'avg_vote', 'votes', 'budget', 'usa_gross_income', 'worlwide_gross_income', 'metascore', 'reviews_from_users', 'reviews_from_critics'], dtype='object') Lets start by looking at basic description of our data.

I tend to think of scatter, box, and histogram plots for numerical data and bar or sunburst charts for categorical data. 6.2.1 Scatter Plots \u00b6 The way to generate a plot in the fewest keystrokes is to simply call the plot() method within the dataframe object df.plot() # the simplest plot we can make is the following so let's start here. # We can generate a figure simply by using the plot() method of our dataframe # object. df . plot () <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7fb4820224d0> This gives us a raw view of the data, but here I'd like to introduce some standard plotting steps: recall the fig , ax format we used previously. fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize = (10, 5)) df.plot(ax=ax) fig , ax1 = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 5 )) df . plot ( ax = ax1 ) ax1 . set_title ( 'My Title' ) Text(0.5, 1.0, 'My Title') To make this into a scatter plot, we set the linestyle (or ls) to an empty string, and select a marker type. fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize = (10, 5)) df.plot(ax=ax, linestyle='', marker='.') fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 5 )) df . plot ( ax = ax , ls = '' , marker = '.' , ms = 2 ) <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7fb481e19610> \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 4: Scatter Plots with Pandas \u00b6 Make a plot of duration vs metascore fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 5 )) df . plot ( 'duration' , 'metascore' , ax = ax , ls = '' , marker = '.' , alpha = 0.9 , ms = 3 ) <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7fb4818eac90> # Cell for Exercise 4 <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7fcd18498ad0> 6.2.2 Bar Plots \u00b6 One of the more common methods of depicting aggregate data is bar plots. We almost always see these kinds of plots used to display and compare between averages, but sometimes between singular data values as well. fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(10,7.5)) df.groupby('country').filter(lambda x: x.shape[0] > 100).\\ groupby('country')['duration'].mean().sort_values()\\ [-20:].plot(kind='barh', ax=ax) def newf ( x ): return x . shape [ 0 ] > 100 fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 7.5 )) df . groupby ( 'country' ) . filter ( newf ) . \\ groupby ( 'country' )[ 'duration' ] . mean () . sort_values () \\ [ - 20 :] . plot ( kind = 'barh' , ax = ax ) <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7fb481741550> fig , ax = plt . subplots ( figsize = ( 10 , 5 )) df . groupby ( 'country' ) . filter ( lambda x : x . shape [ 0 ] > 100 ) . \\ groupby ( 'country' )[ 'duration' ] . mean () . sort_values ()[ - 20 :] \\ . plot ( kind = 'barh' , ax = ax ) <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7fb481413950> fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 7.5 )) df . groupby ( 'country' ) . filter ( lambda x : x . shape [ 0 ] > 100 ) . \\ groupby ( 'country' )[ 'duration' ] . mean () . sort_values () \\ [ - 20 :] . plot ( kind = 'bar' , ax = ax ) # .plot(kind='barh') <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7fb481730350> 6.2.3 Box Plots \u00b6 Maybe we thought it was usefull to see the feature data in the scatter plots ( we can visually scan for correlations between feature sets, check outliers, etc.) but perhaps more instructive, is a boxplot. A box plot or boxplot is a statistical method for graphically depicting aggregate data through their quartiles. It will be useful to inspect the boxplot API to see the default behavior for representing the quartiles and outliers. fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize = (10, 5)) df.plot(kind='box', ax=ax) df [ 'genre' ] . unique () array(['Romance', 'Biography, Crime, Drama', 'Drama', ..., 'Family, War', 'Documentary', 'Crime, War'], dtype=object) fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 7.5 )) df . loc [ df [ 'genre' ] == 'Romance' ] . groupby ( 'country' ) . filter (( lambda x : ( x . shape [ 0 ] > 100 ) # filter by number of datapoints # (x['duration'].mean() < 95) ) # filter by average movie time ) . boxplot ( by = 'country' , column = 'duration' , rot = 90 , ax = ax ) <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7fb480fb1350> 6.2.4 Histograms \u00b6 What are some other kinds of plots we can make? A good one to be aware of is the histogram. plt.title('Demo Hist') plt.xlabel('Duration') plt.ylabel('Frequency') plt.hist(df['duration']) df [[ 'duration' ]] .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } duration 0 45 1 70 2 53 3 100 4 68 ... ... 85850 95 85851 103 85852 130 85853 98 85854 74 85855 rows \u00d7 1 columns .colab-df-container { display:flex; flex-wrap:wrap; gap: 12px; } .colab-df-convert { background-color: #E8F0FE; border: none; border-radius: 50%; cursor: pointer; display: none; fill: #1967D2; height: 32px; padding: 0 0 0 0; width: 32px; } .colab-df-convert:hover { background-color: #E2EBFA; box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15); fill: #174EA6; } [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert { background-color: #3B4455; fill: #D2E3FC; } [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover { background-color: #434B5C; box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)); fill: #FFFFFF; } const buttonEl = document.querySelector('#df-d9eacf1a-f91c-4db0-bfcd-529b67c1cf3f button.colab-df-convert'); buttonEl.style.display = google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

You can think of this plot as exactly like a histogram, except instead of creating bins in which to accrue datapoints, you deposit a gaussian distribution around every datapoint in your dataset. By this mechanism, you avoid creating bias in your data summary as you otherwise would be when predifining bin sizes and locations in a histogram. fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 5 )) df [ 'duration' ] . plot ( kind = 'kde' , ax = ax ) <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7fcd046ac7d0> fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 7.5 )) df . loc [ df [ 'genre' ] == 'Romance' ] . groupby ( 'country' ) . filter (( lambda x : ( x . shape [ 0 ] > 100 ) # filter by number of datapoints # (x['duration'].mean() < 95) ) # filter by average movie time )[ 'duration' ] . plot ( kind = 'kde' , ax = ax ) <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7fb47e8bff50> \ud83c\udf52 6.2.5.1 Enrichment : Skew and Tailedness \u00b6 While we're on the topic of KDEs/histograms and other statistical plots, this is a convenient time to talk about skew and tailedness or, otherwise known as kurtosis df.skew() indicates the skewdness of the data df.kurtosis() indicates the tailedness of the data # from scipy.stats import skewnorm from ipywidgets import FloatSlider slider = FloatSlider ( value = 0.5 , min = 0.5 , max = 5 , step = 0.5 , description = 'Shape:' , disabled = False , continuous_update = False , orientation = 'horizontal' , readout = True , readout_format = '.1f' ) import numpy as np def inspect_kurt_skew ( a = slider ): # theres another hyperparameter, lambda for the center # of weibull. the shape parameter is sometimes called # a, or k fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 5 , 5 )) s = np . random . weibull ( a , 1000 ) statdf = pd . DataFrame ( s ) statdf [ 0 ] . plot ( kind = 'kde' , ax = ax ) print ( \"skew: {:.2f} \" . format ( statdf [ 0 ] . skew ())) print ( \"kurtosis: {:.2f} \" . format ( statdf [ 0 ] . kurt ())) interact ( inspect_kurt_skew ) interactive(children=(FloatSlider(value=0.5, continuous_update=False, description='Shape:', max=5.0, min=0.5, \u2026 <function __main__.inspect_kurt_skew> 6.2.6 Correlation Plots \u00b6 Often, we'll want to quantify the strength of a relationship between input variables. We can do this by calculating correlations. We won't go into great detail here about how Pearson's correlation is calculated, but the StatQuest videos on this subject are here for reference (and are really good... if you can stomach Starmer's humor) StatQuest: Correlation StatQuest: Covariance The main takeaway is that pearson's correlation ranges from -1 to 1 and indicates how positively or negatively correlated the variables in question are. For our purposes, this can give insight into what variables will be important in our machine learning model. We can get the pearson's correlation between all the input features using the dataframe.corr() method.

Typically we'd use a heat map on a feature vs feature grid to view this kind of data. In the following I'm going to use some numpy methods you may not have seen before. Links to the documentation for these methods are at the end of the notebook. import numpy as np fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize = (10,10)) # create a mask to white-out the upper triangle mask = np.triu(np.ones_like(df.corr(), dtype=bool)) # we'll want a divergent colormap for this so our eye # is not attracted to the values close to 0 cmap = sns.diverging_palette(230, 20, as_cmap=True) sns.heatmap(df.corr(), mask=mask, cmap=cmap, ax=ax) sns . heatmap ( df . corr ()) <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7fb47e488bd0> import numpy as np fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 10 )) # create a mask to white-out the upper triangle mask = np . triu ( np . ones_like ( df . corr (), dtype = bool )) # we'll want a divergent colormap for this so our eye # is not attracted to the values close to 0 cmap = sns . diverging_palette ( 230 , 20 , as_cmap = True ) sns . heatmap ( df . corr (), mask = mask , cmap = cmap , ax = ax ) <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7fb47e3768d0> What do we notice? looks like reviews and votes are all pretty correlated. Surprising? 6.3 Visualization with IpyWidgets \u00b6 6.3.1 Interact \u00b6 Here we're going to introduce a very basic use case of IPython's widgets using interact . The interact method ( ipywidgets.interact ) automatically creates user interface (UI) controls for exploring code and data interactively. It is the easiest way to get started using IPython\u2019s widgets. from ipywidgets import interact def my_plot(col=filtdf.select_dtypes('number').columns): fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(10,5)) filtdf.boxplot(column=col, by='country', ax=ax) interact(my_plot) def my_plot ( col = filtdf . select_dtypes ( 'number' ) . columns ): fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 5 )) filtdf . boxplot ( column = col , by = 'country' , ax = ax ) After defining our function that returns our plot, and defining input parameters for the fields we would like to interact with, we call our function with interact interact(my_plot) Let's say we want to look at information from the IMDb data based on country. Because there are so many countries in the database, let's filter it down to only the top 5 countries. How could we do this using value_counts ? Let's try this below top_5_countries = df [ 'country' ] . value_counts ()[: 5 ] . keys () # get list of top 5 countries filtdf = df . loc [ df [ 'country' ] . isin ( top_5_countries )] # only select rows whose country is in the list filtdf . boxplot ( column = 'duration' , by = 'country' ) /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/numpy/core/_asarray.py:83: VisibleDeprecationWarning: Creating an ndarray from ragged nested sequences (which is a list-or-tuple of lists-or-tuples-or ndarrays with different lengths or shapes) is deprecated.

I'm going to create a list of x and y values and plot them with pyplot x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] y = [1,1,2,3,5,8,13] plt.plot(x,y) x = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] y = [ 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 ] plt . plot ( x , y ) [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7fb4a1d75ed0>] We can label the axes of our figure using the xlabel and ylabel attributes, and label our title using the title attribute. plt.plot([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[1,1,2,3,5,8,13]) plt.title('The Fibonacci Sequence') plt.xlabel('Order in Sequence') plt.ylabel('Value') plt . plot ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ],[ 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 ]) plt . title ( 'The Fibonacci Sequence' ) plt . xlabel ( 'Order in Sequence' ) plt . ylabel ( 'Value' ) Text(0, 0.5, 'Value')","title":"6.1.1 The Basics"},{"location":"solutions/SOLN_S6_Matplotlib/#question-1","text":"What do we think about the out-of-the-box formatting of pyplot ? What are some things we can do to make it better? Could we make it bigger? Perhaps different dimensions? Does anyone recognize that default line color? Before we make any changes, let's become acquianted with the more appropriate way to work in matplotlib.pyplot . In this formality, we explicitly create our figure and axes objects. # This is one way to do it... # plt.plot([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[1,1,2,3,5,8,13]) # but we can also do it this way, concretely declaring the figure, axes # objects directly # We declare the figure fig = plt.figure() # and then add axes ax = fig.add_subplot(111) You can think of the figure as a canvas, where you specify dimensions and possibly unifying attributes of its contents, like, background color, border, etc. You use the canvas, the figure , to containerize your other objects, primarily your axes , and to save its contents with savefig . You can think of an axes as the actual graphs or plots themselves. And when we declare these objects, we have access to all the methods of matplotlib.pyplot (e.g. .plot , .scatter , .hist etc.) You can place many of these axes into the figure container in a variety of ways. The last component of a pyplot figure are the axis , the graphical axis we typically think of. # This is one way to do it... # plt.plot([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[1,1,2,3,5,8,13]) # but we can also do it this way, concretely declaring the figure, axes # objects directly # We declare the figure fig = plt . figure () # and then add axes ax = fig . add_subplot ( 111 ) # number of rows, number of columns, # from left to right and top to bottom the individual axes that # this add_subplot call is creating plt.subplots returns a figure and axes object(s) together: ### We can also do it in 1 line fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(8,8)) and we'll go ahead and adjust the figure size with the parameter figsize and set it equal to a tuple containing the x and y dimensions of the figure in inches. ### We can also do it in 1 line fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 ) To recap, by convention we typically separate our plots into three components: a Figure, its Axes, and their Axis: Figure : It is a whole figure which may contain one or more than one axes (plots). You can think of a figure as a canvas which contains plots. Axes : It is what we generally think of as a plot. A figure can contain many axes . It contains two or three (in the case of 3D) axis objects. Each axes has a title, an x-label and a y-label. Axis : They are the traditional axis we think of in a graph and take care of generating the graph limits.

wesleybeckner@gmail.com Today, we will jump into the Numpy package. numpy : Numerical Python \u00b6 Numpy is short for \"Numerical Python\", and contains tools for efficient manipulation of arrays of data. If you have used other computational tools like IDL or MatLab, Numpy should feel very familiar. Import Libraries \u00b6 # for numpy section import numpy as np np . random . seed ( 42 ) # for debugging section import random from contextlib import contextmanager import sys , os @contextmanager def suppress_stdout (): with open ( os . devnull , \"w\" ) as devnull : old_stdout = sys . stdout sys . stdout = devnull try : yield finally : sys . stdout = old_stdout 7.1 NumPy Arrays \u00b6 7.1.1 Creating NumPy Arrays \u00b6 When we worked with lists, we saw that we could fill them with all sorts of datatypes. NumPy arrays are necessarily of one datatype: # these will all be ints np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 5 , 4 ]) array([1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4]) # these will all be floats np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3.14 , 6 , 5 , 4 ]) array([1. , 2. , 3.14, 6. , 5. , 4. ]) We can check the data types in the standard way: arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 5 , 4 ]) for i in arr : print ( type ( i )) <class 'numpy.int64'> <class 'numpy.int64'> <class 'numpy.int64'> <class 'numpy.int64'> <class 'numpy.int64'> <class 'numpy.int64'> We see that all types are upcast to the most complext object in the array. For instance, because 3.14 is a float, all the other numbers in the array will be a float: for i in np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3.14 , 6 , 5 , 4 ]): print ( type ( i )) <class 'numpy.float64'> <class 'numpy.float64'> <class 'numpy.float64'> <class 'numpy.float64'> <class 'numpy.float64'> <class 'numpy.float64'> We can also specify the datatypes in the array: np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3.14 , 6 , 5 , 4 ], dtype = 'float32' ) array([1. , 2. , 3.14, 6. , 5. , 4. ], dtype=float32) \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 1: Specify datatype \u00b6 Create an array of 5 numbers whose datatypes are 16 bit integers. Make one of the numbers not a whole number. What happens to the number when it is stored in the 16 bit integer array? # Cell for Exercise 1 arr = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3.14 , 6 , 5 , 4 ], dtype = 'int16' ) [ print ( type ( i )) for i in arr ] arr [ 0 ] = 2.2 [ print ( type ( i )) for i in arr ] arr <class 'numpy.int16'> <class 'numpy.int16'> <class 'numpy.int16'> <class 'numpy.int16'> <class 'numpy.int16'> <class 'numpy.int16'> <class 'numpy.int16'> <class 'numpy.int16'> <class 'numpy.int16'> <class 'numpy.int16'> <class 'numpy.int16'> <class 'numpy.int16'> array([2, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4], dtype=int16) 7.1.2 Creating Arrays from NumPy Methods \u00b6 # create an array of 10 zeros # how can we specify the datatype? np . zeros ( 10 ) array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]) # create an array of 10 1's np . ones ( 10 ) array([1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.]) # fill an array of the following dimensions # with value 42 np . full (( 2 , 3 ), 42 ) array([[42, 42, 42], [42, 42, 42]]) # arange from start (inc) to stop (exc) # integers with step size np . arange ( 1 , 10 , 2 ) array([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) # create an array of numbers that divides # the space between start and stop (inc, inc) # with X equally spaced intervals np . linspace ( 0 , 10 , 5 ) array([ 0. , 2.5, 5. , 7.5, 10. ]) # create an array of values drawn from a # uniform distribution np . random . random ( 5 ) array([0.37454012, 0.95071431, 0.73199394, 0.59865848, 0.15601864]) # create an array of values from a normal distribution np . random . normal ( loc = 0 , scale = 1 , size = ( 5 , 5 )) array([[ 0.27904129, 1.01051528, -0.58087813, -0.52516981, -0.57138017], [-0.92408284, -2.61254901, 0.95036968, 0.81644508, -1.523876 ], [-0.42804606, -0.74240684, -0.7033438 , -2.13962066, -0.62947496], [ 0.59772047, 2.55948803, 0.39423302, 0.12221917, -0.51543566], [-0.60025385, 0.94743982, 0.291034 , -0.63555974, -1.02155219]]) # create an array of random integers between 5 and 10 with shape 2x2 np . random . randint ( 5 , 11 , ( 2 , 2 )) array([[ 9, 7], [10, 5]]) \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Exercise 2: Creating Arrays \u00b6 a.

This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached. 1000000 loops, best of 5: 362 ns per loop %% timeit my_arr [ 0 , 0 ] The slowest run took 38.37 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached. 10000000 loops, best of 5: 177 ns per loop We can use the same slicing notation as with lists my_arr[start:stop:step] for n-dimensional arrays my_arr[1-start:1-stop:1-step, 2-start:2-stop:2-step, ... n-start:n-stop:n-step] # with arrays, we simply separate each dimension with a comma my_arr [: 2 , : 2 ] array([[7, 5], [5, 9]]) Slices are views not copies. This means we can set slices of arrays to new values, and the original object will change: my_arr [: 2 , : 2 ] = 0 my_arr array([[0, 0, 7, 9, 7], [0, 0, 6, 7, 5], [6, 6, 8, 9, 7], [5, 8, 9, 8, 9], [9, 7, 9, 8, 9]]) my_arr [ - 2 :, - 2 :] = 1 my_arr array([[0, 0, 7, 9, 7], [0, 0, 6, 7, 5], [6, 6, 8, 9, 7], [5, 8, 9, 1, 1], [9, 7, 9, 1, 1]]) Step through an array slice # remember that we can use steps in slicing my_arr [:, :: 2 ] # the last number after :: is the step size array([[0, 7, 7], [0, 6, 5], [6, 8, 7], [5, 9, 1], [9, 9, 1]]) We can use negative step sizes the way we do with lists. A negative step size reverses the order of start and stop, so it is a convenient way to reverse the order of one or more dimensions of an array # reverse the rows my_arr [:: - 1 ] array([[9, 7, 9, 1, 1], [5, 8, 9, 1, 1], [6, 6, 8, 9, 7], [0, 0, 6, 7, 5], [0, 0, 7, 9, 7]]) # reverse the columns my_arr [:, :: - 1 ] array([[7, 9, 7, 0, 0], [5, 7, 6, 0, 0], [7, 9, 8, 6, 6], [1, 1, 9, 8, 5], [1, 1, 9, 7, 9]]) Sometimes we want to create a copy of an array, despite the default slicing behavior.
